"Switching from Windows to Ubuntu in 2010 for my personal computer was my best choice about anything related to IT. Until I switched to Nixos. Now I consider switching to Nixos the best choice I have ever made, related to IT.

But it's a **steep learning curve**, you have to dive in this new philosophy. You have to commit to it. Everything WILL NOT be as you wish from the start. But the reward after some time is unthinkable. Not possible to imagine since it is a paradigm shift: another way of thinking, another way of doing

The most striking would be: I have my configuration in one git repository. I can go back to a previous configuration. It unloads the mind from a burden of tons of details: you know everything is in this/these text files so as that makes your system work. I can even replicate my configuration on other computers, so I just simply do not care if ever one computer goes out of order. In less than two hours I have the same configuration that I can run on a another desktop/laptop."
