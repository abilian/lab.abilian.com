The "SQLite database is locked" error typically occurs when multiple threads or processes try to access the same SQLite database simultaneously. SQLite, being a lightweight database management system, is not designed for high levels of concurrency. 

To prevent this error, consider the following strategies:

1. **Use a Queue**: Implement a queue system where a single thread or process interacts with the database. Other threads/processes can add their database requests to the queue, and the designated database thread/process can execute these requests sequentially.

2. **Transaction Management**: Make use of transactions and ensure that they are as short as possible. Long transactions can lock the database for a significant amount of time, increasing the likelihood of this error.

3. **Database Connection Pooling**: If you are using multiple threads, ensure each thread has its own connection to the database. Connection pooling can be beneficial in managing these connections efficiently.

4. **File Locking Mechanisms**: Implement a file locking mechanism to prevent simultaneous write operations. This can be done manually or by using third-party libraries.

5. **Timeouts and Retry Logic**: Implement a retry logic with timeouts. When a thread/process encounters a locked database, it can wait for a predefined duration before retrying.

6. **Switch to WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) Mode**: SQLite supports a write-ahead logging mode that allows concurrent reads and writes. However, this might not be suitable for all applications, as it has its own limitations and requirements.

7. **Avoid Long-Running Read Transactions**: Long-running read transactions can prevent write transactions from proceeding, leading to a lock. Make sure that read transactions are completed as quickly as possible.

8. **Optimize Database Access**: Review and optimize your database access patterns. Efficient queries and well-structured data can reduce the time each transaction takes, thus reducing the likelihood of conflicts.

9. **SQLite PRAGMA Statements**: Use PRAGMA statements to tweak SQLite's behavior. For instance, `PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;` sets a timeout, after which the SQLite engine will give up if it cannot get a lock.

10. **Alternative Database Solutions**: If concurrency is a major requirement for your application, consider using a more robust database management system designed for higher concurrency, like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Each of these strategies has its own trade-offs and should be considered in the context of your specific application requirements and constraints.
