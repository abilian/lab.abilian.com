PhaidraAI: "For now, Aleph Alpha is settling into its new strategy. In July, it announced that government employees in its home state of Baden-Württemberg would soon start using the system now called PhaidraAI. During an interview, Andrulis briefly showed it off — an interface that lets public employees tap AI tools to do tasks like manage files, sift through documents or write emails. This shift moves away from merely competing in the generative AI model race and towards becoming a comprehensive provider of AI infrastructure that supports transparency and data sovereignty, especially under Europe's AI regulations. Aleph Alpha continues to prioritize flexibility, transparency, and domain-specific optimization in its offerings, positioning itself as a critical partner for organizations looking for secure AI solutions."
