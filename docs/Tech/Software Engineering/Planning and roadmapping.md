Planning and roadmapping play an essential role in software development, even in the face of uncertainty or for research and development (R&D) projects, due to several reasons:

1.  **Direction and Vision:** The roadmap provides a clear direction and vision for the project. It helps the team understand the end goal and how they are going to reach it. Without a roadmap, the team may lose sight of their objectives and make decisions that don't align with the overall goals.
2.  **Prioritization:** With a roadmap, the team can prioritize tasks based on their importance and deadlines. This helps to make sure that the most critical functionalities are developed first and less critical ones later. It also helps to allocate resources effectively.
3.  **Stakeholder Communication:** A roadmap can serve as a communication tool with stakeholders. It provides stakeholders with a clear picture of what to expect and when to expect it. It can also help manage their expectations and reduce the potential for miscommunication or confusion.
4.  **Risk Management:** Planning helps in identifying potential risks and devising strategies to mitigate them. This can include anything from technical debt, scope creep, to unavailability of key team members.
5.  **Efficiency and Productivity:** Having a plan allows for smoother operations, reducing the time spent on deciding what to do next. It also helps in reducing rework, as the team knows what they need to develop and can design it correctly the first time.
6.  **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Even in uncertain or R&D environments, having a plan does not mean being inflexible. Agile methodologies, for instance, emphasize iterative planning and flexibility in response to changes. A plan provides a starting point and a framework within which changes can be managed and integrated.
7.  **Measurement and Evaluation:** A plan allows for the establishment of milestones and key performance indicators (KPIs). These can help track progress, measure productivity, and evaluate the project's success.

Remember, the goal of planning and roadmapping isn't to predict the future perfectly; it's to lay out a strategic vision and provide a structured way to approach and navigate the inherent uncertainties of software development.
