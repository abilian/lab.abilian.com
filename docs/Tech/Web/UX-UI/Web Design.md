Creating a website that looks and feels good might seem like a monumental task, but making it “not ugly” is easier than you think. Here’s a quick guide on some basic design principles that can help make your site more usable, credible, and engaging, based on [this conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf0cjocP8Wk) by Hilary Stohs-Krause.

### Why Design Matters

A few key reasons why design is crucial:

1. **Usability**: Good design informs functionality, guiding users intuitively.
2. **Credibility**: Visual design heavily influences credibility. In a Stanford study, nearly half of users attributed a website’s trustworthiness to its appearance.
3. **Interest**: We have between 10 seconds to milliseconds to grab someone’s attention. The initial visual impression matters.

### 1. Making Text Content Readable and Engaging

To get visitors to interact with your content, make text easy to read and scan. Here’s how:

#### a. **Line Length and Height**
- Optimal reading speed is achieved around 50-100 characters per line.
- Use CSS `ch` units to define line length by characters instead of pixels.
- Increase line height for readability—New York Times uses a 1.5 line height, making large blocks of text less intimidating.

#### b. **Use Padding Wisely**
- Allow space around text to prevent it from crowding the edges or other elements.
- Avoid cramming columns too close; otherwise, readers may struggle to know where lines begin and end.

#### c. **Color and Contrast**
- Avoid low-contrast text. Tools like WebAIM’s contrast checker can help you test readability and accessibility.
- Start with a default font size of 16px and adjust based on your typeface and audience.

#### d. **Scannability with Subheads and Bullet Points**
- People typically read only about 20-25% of the content on a page, so use subheads, bolded keywords, and bullet points to help them locate important information quickly.
- Follow the “First Two Words” rule: begin headings with key info, as users often skim the first two words before deciding to read on.

### 2. Using Images and Icons Effectively

Images and icons can enhance or harm your design. Here’s how to get it right:

#### a. **Icons Should Have Labels**
- Icons without text often confuse users, as many icons lack universal meanings.
- Labeling improves understanding—studies show that labeled icons are accurately recognized 88% of the time.

#### b. **Integrate Images into Content**
- Avoid placing images in traditional ad areas, which people often ignore (known as “banner blindness”).
- Make sure images relate directly to content; users notice plain text and faces before other types of visuals.

### 3. Logical, Pattern-Based Layout

A logical design that follows predictable patterns minimizes user frustration. Here are a few guidelines:

#### a. **Keep Patterns Simple**
- Users are more likely to stay on a website with predictable layouts. Stick to consistent formatting for columns and rows.
- An alternating layout (e.g., two columns, three columns, one wide row) keeps the page interesting without overwhelming.

#### b. **Follow the F-Shape Reading Pattern**
- Users naturally read in an F or E shape, focusing most attention on the top left. Place your essential content there for maximum engagement.
- Don’t cram everything at the top—leave white space so users can focus on key areas without feeling bombarded.

#### c. **Use Consistency for Predictability**
- Buttons, links, and forms should follow the same visual patterns throughout your site.
- Consistent visuals build user trust, allowing them to focus on the content instead of wondering about navigation.

### 4. Functionality and Design Go Hand-in-Hand

Design isn’t only about visuals; it’s about functionality, too.

- **Limit Bugs**: Smooth functionality is as essential as aesthetics. The design should aid the user experience by providing error-free interactions.
- **Design Thinking**: Consider functionality from the back-end as well, especially when creating interactive features like tables or filters.

### Final Takeaways

Design doesn’t have to be complex. A few thoughtful choices can help your site go from “ugly” to “not ugly,” and make it far more user-friendly:

- **Readable text** with proper line length, height, and contrast.
- **Appropriate use of icons and images**, adding value rather than clutter.
- **Logical layout patterns** that follow user expectations and F-shape reading.
- **Functional consistency**, ensuring that everything from forms to buttons works as expected.
