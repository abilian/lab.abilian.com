## Principles / recommendations
Do not confuse navigation tabs and in-page tabs. In-page tabs should not be used to navigate to different areas of a website or app, and definitely shouldn’t be used to replace navigation patterns like breadcrumbs.

When to use: “Use tabs to alternate between views within the same context, not to navigate to different areas. This is the single most important point, because staying in place while alternating views is the reason we have tabs in the first place.” (From Jakob Nielsen)

First, design the information architecture (IA) of your site so you can make smarter tab-related decisions.
