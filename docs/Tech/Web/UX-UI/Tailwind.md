## Why use Tailwind

### Pros

- https://dev.to/brendanrc2/why-we-use-tailwind-at-convertkit-1660
- -> "why do we use Tailwind? **Because it simplifies just about everything when it comes to styling UI across our teams**. It eliminates decisions of where to put things or how to write them. It comes with great documentation. For teams, especially with varying backgrounds and UI skill levels, Tailwind is a massive productivity boost."

-> The redesign shipped months ago, which gave me plenty of time to live with my decision to use Tailwind. My conclusion: the choice was an unambiguously good one. The main reasons are:

- **Speed:** I can immediately begin writing styles in components because Tailwind is global and pre-generated from defaults and my configuration. Styles do not need to be imported or created by me.
- **Shared language:** Polytomic’s design team uses Tailwind’s design system. When implementing a feature, I can count on design mocks sticking to Tailwind’s values and scales.
- **Expressiveness**: I have been able to execute every design given to me. Tailwind has not limited me. When I have used non-Tailwind CSS, it has been for specific browser overrides, mostly Safari.
- **Contextual adjustments:** many components need CSS adjustments depending on their context. Changing a className string rather than overriding CSS via the cascade is less error prone for me. I eliminated the problem of specificity collisions.\
  It’s a choice that—in hindsight—I would make again.
