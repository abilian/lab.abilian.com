## UI Frameworks

### Vuejs frameworks

See also: [[Detailed stats on vue UI frameworks]].

Forms -> several interesting projects.

#### With design systems

- Ant Design Vue (Alibaba): https://github.com/vueComponent/ant-design-vue
- Carbon Vue (IBM): https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-vue
- Buefy: https://buefy.org/
- SAP: https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-vue & https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/get-started/ & https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/ (open source)
- Element: https://element-plus.org/
- https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/overview/components (very large!)

=> None of these is really satisfying.

2nd try:

- [[Primevue]] https://www.primefaces.org/primevue/

### Headless (= CSS less)

- https://github.com/oruga-ui/oruga (CSS-less components, Vue2 and Vue3)
- Headlessui <https://headlessui.dev/>

#### Zoom sur Ant Design

- Ant is now compatible with vue 3: https://2x.antdv.com/components/overview/
	- Higher level: https://store.antdv.com/pro/preview/system/permission-list (not free!)

#### Without design systems
- Oruga: https://dev.to/astagi/oruga-the-new-kid-on-the-block-1n55

#### Non-free

### Alternatives to Vue
- [[Svelte]]

### Alternatives to the main frameworks
- https://github.com/ryansolid/solid "A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces."

- Speed comparison: https://rawgit.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/master/webdriver-ts-results/table.html

### For lightweight interactivity

- https://htmx.org/ + hyperscript
- AlpineJS
- Petite Vue
- Hyperapp

- https://ractive.js.org/ "Ractive.js is a template-driven UI library that transforms your templates, styles and logic into blueprints for highly interactive apps." (<- By Rich Harris, who's now working on Svelte - so OLD/unmaintained?)

### Server-side (not Python)

- https://hotwire.dev/ "Hotwire is an alternative approach to building modern web applications without using much JavaScript by sending HTML instead of JSON over the wire."
- https://inertiajs.com/ "Inertia.js lets you quickly build modern single-page React, Vue and Svelte apps using classic server-side routing and controllers."
- Opa
- Eliom (ocaml)
- Truc en LISP (HOP / hopjs)

### Server-side (Python)

- IDOM: https://idom-docs.herokuapp.com/ "Create highly interactive web pages purely in Python" (Python + JS/React)
- https://flexx.readthedocs.io/ (Pure Python!) "Flexx is a pure Python toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIâ€™s), that uses web technology for its rendering. Apps are written purely in Python; The [PScript](https://pscript.readthedocs.io/) transpiler generates the necessary JavaScript on the fly."
- Django-unicorn: https://www.django-unicorn.com/ " Quickly add in simple interactions to regular Django templates without learning a new templating language."
- https://lona-web.org/ "Lona is a web application framework, designed to write responsive web apps in **full** Python."
- http://atlastk.org/ "It's lightweight, available for several languages, and requires only basic knowledge of widespread and easy-to-learn web technologies (no frontend JavaScript required)." (Probably not what we want)
- https://github.com/edelvalle/reactor/
- https://github.com/jonathan-s/django-sockpuppet

### Real-time

- https://docs.feathersjs.com/ - Feathers is a lightweight web-framework for creating real-time applications and REST APIs using JavaScript or TypeScript.
