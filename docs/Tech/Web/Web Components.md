"While Web Components provide strong encapsulation for reusable components, React provides a declarative library that keeps the DOM in sync with your data."

"For example, web components are faster and more memory-efficient than React (according to [this benchmark](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/)) because they are browser-native. But creating web components using the standard API is complex and not so developer-friendly compared to JSX-based React. However, the Lit-like libraries let you create web components in a React-like simple way."

### Lit vs. Stencil

Lit (formerly LitElement and lit-html), developed by the Polymer team at Google, is known for its simplicity and small size. It uses JavaScript templates, which makes it feel like just using JavaScript. It's excellent for building light-weight web components quickly.

Stencil, developed by the Ionic team, is more feature-rich and includes a number of built-in tools like a JSX renderer, automatic generation of components for various frameworks (React, Vue, Angular), and automatic generation of Progressive Web Apps. It's often seen as a toolchain or a compiler rather than just a library. Stencil could be a good choice if you need to create components that are compatible with multiple frameworks, or if you're building a large-scale application.
