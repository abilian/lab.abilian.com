[Fish](https://fishshell.com/) is an alternate shell that is faster and saner than bash and zsh.

Compared to [xonch](https://xon.sh/), it's much faster, and reasonably supported (including by virtualenv).

Tips:

- Use the virtualfish plugin by doing `pipx install virtualfish` then `vf addplugins auto_activation`.
