[[00 Nix & NixOS|Nix]] and [[Guix]] are both functional package managers and system configuration tools. Key functional differences stem from their implementation languages (the Nix package manager uses C++ and Perl with its own Nix expression language for configuration, while Guix uses Guile Scheme), philosophical commitments (Nix: pragmatic; Guix: strict free software), governance (Nix: NixOS Foundation, community-driven with corporate backing; Guix: GNU project), and package availability. Guix generally offers a stricter reproducibility and security model, prioritizing software freedom, while Nix provides a larger ecosystem and greater flexibility.

Here are more details on these aspects:

### Governance and Philosophy

-   **Nix**: Nix is primarily developed by a large, active community, governed by the **NixOS Foundation**. It receives significant contributions and commercial support from companies like Tweag, Determinate Systems, and others; the NLnet Foundation has also historically provided grants. Nix focuses heavily on practical, general-purpose system management. While NixOS provides full system configuration for Linux, the Nix package manager itself works on multiple operating systems, including macOS, Linux, and (with limitations) Windows.
-   **Guix**: Guix is a GNU project, adhering strictly to the GNU philosophy of free software and emphasizing software freedom, reproducibility, and user empowerment. Guix has more political and philosophical constraints regarding free software compared to Nix, as it strictly avoids non-free software or dependencies in its repositories.

### System Management

-   **Nix**: The Nix ecosystem supports a diverse range of system configurations, and NixOS is a Linux distribution built around the Nix package manager. NixOS enables declarative system configuration, allowing users to describe the entire state of a system, from the kernel to services, in Nix expressions.
-   **Guix**: Guix provides similar functionality through the **Guix System**, a distribution that parallels NixOS, built entirely on Guix. Like NixOS, the Guix System is declarative and supports reproducible system management. Guix offers finer granularity in managing user environments, particularly in multi-user systems, with a stronger focus on security and privilege separation.

### Reproducibility

-   **Nix**: Reproducibility is a core feature of Nix. However, achieving bit-for-bit identical builds can require careful management of impurities (e.g., build timestamps, uncontrolled network access if sandboxing is relaxed). The **Nix Flakes** system significantly improves reproducibility by explicitly declaring and pinning all dependencies, making projects more self-contained and easier to share. Nix's pragmatism sometimes allows for flexibility that may impact strict bit-for-bit reproducibility by default compared to Guix.
-   **Guix**: Guix aims for **bit-for-bit reproducibility** in all its packages. The GNU Guix project tracks this rigorously, and the development process emphasizes it. Guix also champions **auditable bootstrapping**, striving to build the entire system from a minimal, auditable set of trusted binaries, further enhancing trust and verifiability in its commitment to software freedom and reproducibility.

### Package Management

-   **Nix**: Nix uses **Nix expressions**, a custom functional language designed specifically for describing packages and system configurations. Nix focuses on **atomic upgrades** and **rollbacks** through its purely functional package management system, which ensures that installations and upgrades are isolated from each other, avoiding package conflicts and dependency hell.
-   **Guix**: Guix also employs a functional package management system but uses **Guile Scheme** for package definitions. This may offer greater extensibility and composability due to Schemeâ€™s nature as a fully-fledged programming language. Guix puts an additional focus on **user environments** (profiles), allowing more control over package environments for individual users.

### Non-Free Software

-   **Nix**: Nix is pragmatic, allowing non-free software in its package repositories. Nixpkgs (the main repository) segregates these, and users must explicitly enable the `allowUnfree` option to install them.
-   **Guix**: Guix strictly adheres to the Free Software Foundation's guidelines, disallowing non-free software in its main repositories. While the official project does not support non-free software, the community maintains the **`Nonguix`** channel for users who need such packages, though it's kept separate.

### Security Model

-   **Nix**: Nix uses a sandboxing mechanism to isolate builds and ensure reproducibility, but it has more flexibility when it comes to disabling sandboxing (e.g., allowing non-sandboxed builds if necessary). The Nix daemon typically runs as root, though unprivileged user namespaces are an option in some contexts.
-   **Guix**: Guix takes security further by implementing **unprivileged package management** by default; the Guix daemon runs as an unprivileged user for most operations, enhancing security in multi-user environments. Guix also enforces stricter sandboxing policies.

### Development Experience

-   **Nix**: Nix has a steeper learning curve due to the Nix expression language's unique nature. The community provides extensive documentation. Tools like `nix-shell`, `nix-build`, and the newer **Nix Flakes** system (with commands like `nix develop`) offer powerful ways to manage development environments. Flakes, in particular, simplify project setup and sharing.
-   **Guix**: Guix uses Guile Scheme, a general-purpose Lisp dialect. This offers great power and flexibility for defining packages, managing environments (e.g., with `guix shell`), and configuring the Guix System. For those familiar with Lisp, Guix can feel very expressive and natural; for others, it presents the learning curve of a full programming language.

### Community and Ecosystem

-   **Nix**: Nix has a larger and more diverse ecosystem, partly due to its multi-platform support and pragmatic stance on non-free software. **Nixpkgs**, the main package collection, is one of the largest available (e.g., over 80,000 packages, though this number grows constantly), making Nix very versatile.
-   **Guix**: Guix has a smaller but highly dedicated community focused on its core principles. Its package collection is more curated and smaller (e.g., over 20,000 packages, growing) but prioritizes reproducibility and software freedom, sometimes leading to less immediate availability of the newest or proprietary software compared to Nix.

### Extensibility and Customization

-   **Nix**: Nix offers a wide range of options for customizing package builds, system configurations, and environments, primarily through the Nix language.
-   **Guix**: With Guix being based on Guile Scheme, users can customize the package manager and system configuration to a greater extent using the powerful features of Scheme. Guix is designed to be a highly extensible system where users can define their own system services, package transformations, and more, using the full power of a Lisp dialect.

### Conclusion: Which to Choose?

Ultimately, the choice between Nix and Guix often comes down to priorities:

-   **Choose Nix/NixOS if:** You value a very large package ecosystem, broad platform support (including macOS), pragmatic solutions (including easier access to non-free software if needed), and are comfortable with its unique DSL. The introduction of Flakes has also significantly improved its usability and reproducibility story.
-   **Choose Guix/Guix System if:** Your top priorities are software freedom, the highest degree of bit-for-bit reproducibility, auditable bootstrapping, and a system configurable with a powerful general-purpose language (Guile Scheme). You are willing to accept a smaller package selection and a stricter adherence to free software principles.
