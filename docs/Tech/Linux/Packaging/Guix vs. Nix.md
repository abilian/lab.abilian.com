[[00 Nix & NixOS|Nix]] and [[Guix]] are both functional package managers and system configuration tools, but there are several key functional differences between them beyond their choice of implementation languages (Nix is written in Nix, while Guix is written in Guile/Scheme). 

Their differences arise primarily from their philosophical commitments (e.g., Nix being more pragmatic vs. Guix's strict adherence to free software), implementation languages (Nix vs. Guile Scheme), governance (Nix being corporate-backed, Guix being a GNU project), and package availability. Additionally, Guix offers a stricter security and reproducibility model, making it more attractive for users with strong preferences for freedom, security, and privacy, while Nix provides greater flexibility and a larger ecosystem.

Here are more details:

### Governance and Philosophy
- **Nix**: Nix is primarily developed by the Nix community and is more corporate-driven, with commercial support from companies like Tweag and NLNet Labs. Nix focuses heavily on practical, general-purpose system management across various platforms. While Nix can be used for system configuration (e.g., with NixOS), its package manager works on multiple operating systems, including macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- **Guix**: Guix is a GNU project, adhering strictly to the GNU philosophy of free software and emphasizing software freedom, reproducibility, and user empowerment. Guix has more political and philosophical constraints regarding free software compared to Nix, as it strictly avoids non-free software or dependencies in its repositories.

### System Management
- **Nix**: The Nix ecosystem supports a diverse range of system configurations, and NixOS is a Linux distribution built around the Nix package manager. NixOS enables declarative system configuration, allowing users to describe the entire state of a system, from the kernel to services, in Nix expressions. While Nix itself is primarily a package manager, NixOS extends it into full system configuration management.
- **Guix**: Guix provides similar functionality through the **Guix System**, a distribution that parallels NixOS, built entirely on Guix. Like NixOS, the Guix System is declarative and supports reproducible system management. Guix offers finer granularity in managing user environments, particularly in multi-user systems, with a stronger focus on security and privilege separation (such as avoiding the need for privileged operations by the package manager).

### Reproducibility
- **Nix**: Reproducibility is a core feature of Nix, ensuring that packages and environments can be precisely replicated by using the same Nix expression. However, Nix is not as strict as Guix regarding byte-for-byte reproducibility. Nix expressions are more flexible, allowing for pragmatism in package definitions, even if this means occasional compromises in strict reproducibility.
- **Guix**: Guix aims for **perfect reproducibility** in all its packages, aiming for byte-for-byte identical builds. The GNU Guix project tracks reproducibility more rigorously, and the development process ensures that Guix packages do not depend on non-reproducible builds or binaries (like binary blobs), adhering to a higher standard of software freedom and reproducibility.

### Package Management
- **Nix**: Nix uses **Nix expressions**, a custom functional language designed specifically for describing packages and system configurations. Nix focuses on **atomic upgrades** and **rollbacks** through its purely functional package management system, which ensures that installations and upgrades are isolated from each other, avoiding package conflicts and dependency hell.
- **Guix**: Guix also employs a functional package management system but uses **Guile Scheme** for package definitions, which may offer greater extensibility and composability due to Scheme’s nature as a fully-fledged programming language. Guix puts an additional focus on **user environments** (profiles), allowing more control over package environments for individual users in multi-user setups.

### Non-Free Software
- **Nix**: Nix is more pragmatic in its approach, allowing the inclusion of non-free software in its package repositories, though Nixpkgs (the official package repository) segregates free and non-free software into separate channels. NixOS, in particular, can install non-free packages as long as users explicitly enable the `allowUnfree` option.
- **Guix**: Guix adheres strictly to the Free Software Foundation's guidelines and does not allow any non-free software in its main repositories. It includes only free software and even avoids providing any means to install non-free packages within the default configuration, reinforcing the GNU philosophy.

### Security Model
- **Nix**: Nix uses a sandboxing mechanism to isolate builds and ensure that packages are reproducible, but it has more flexibility when it comes to disabling sandboxing (e.g., allowing non-sandboxed builds if necessary). The Nix sandbox can be overridden for certain packages or builds.
- **Guix**: Guix takes security further by implementing **unprivileged package management**, meaning users do not need root access to manage their packages. This enhances security in multi-user environments by ensuring users cannot interfere with each other’s environments or packages. Guix also enforces stricter sandboxing policies, which cannot be easily bypassed.

### Development Experience
- **Nix**: Nix has a steeper learning curve, particularly due to the Nix language's idiosyncrasies. However, the Nix community has developed extensive documentation, and there are several tools like `nix-env`, `nix-shell`, and `nix-build` to help manage development environments. The Nix language is functional but fairly minimalistic, requiring custom solutions for many things.
- **Guix**: Guix leverages Guile Scheme, a general-purpose language, which provides more power and flexibility in defining packages and managing environments. For users familiar with Lisp-like languages, Guix can feel more expressive. The Guix system allows defining not just package builds but more complex system configurations through Scheme, making it a strong fit for developers interested in highly customizable systems.

### Community and Ecosystem
- **Nix**: Nix has a larger and more diverse ecosystem due to its wider use across different operating systems and the more flexible stance on free versus non-free software. The Nixpkgs repository is vast and supports many packages across platforms, making Nix more versatile for general-purpose software deployment.
- **Guix**: Guix has a smaller but very dedicated community focused on freedom, reproducibility, and security. The ecosystem is smaller but more curated, as Guix developers put more effort into ensuring package reproducibility and software freedom. This means that Guix often lags behind in package availability compared to Nix, but it maintains a strict adherence to its principles.

### Extensibility and Customization
- **Nix**: Nix offers a wide range of options for customizing package builds, system configurations, and environments. However, these customizations are often done through the Nix language itself, which may be less powerful than a full programming language.
- **Guix**: With Guix being based on Guile Scheme, users can customize the package manager and system configuration to a greater extent using the powerful features of Scheme. Guix is designed to be a highly extensible system where users can define their own system services, packages, and more, using the full power of a Lisp dialect.
