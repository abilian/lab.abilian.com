### Digital Sovereignty and Privacy

Adopting Linux across public institutions is a powerful move towards **digital sovereignty**, reducing the EU's reliance on foreign, proprietary software from the US or China. By exercising some level of control on the source code, the EU can ensure the highest levels of data privacy and protect sensitive information from potential foreign interference. Linux not only enables compliance with EU-specific privacy standards like GDPR but also puts data ownership directly in the hands of EU citizens, building public trust in digital governance.

### Innovation and Education

Open-source systems like Linux are not just cost-effective; they are also **platforms for innovation**. Implementing an EU-wide Linux operating system would provide a foundation upon which to build new, innovative applications and services tailored to public needs.

## Annex: Timeline of Sovereign OS Ideas in France: Critique, Vision, and Missed Opportunities

In recent years, the urgency for digital sovereignty in France has intensified, driven by legislative initiatives and public debate. The vision for a “sovereign OS” reflects France’s ongoing commitment to securing autonomy, protecting individual freedoms, and establishing control over digital infrastructure—a commitment that, while noble, has often been overshadowed by criticism and skepticism. Many detractors, including influential technologists and digital liberties advocates, could have focused more on the positive aspects of this initiative, particularly given that the project was clearly conceived as a Linux-based distribution rather than a “from scratch” operating system.

### 2016: The Sovereign OS Debate and Delphine Batho’s Vision

In 2016, [French MP Delphine Batho championed the idea of a sovereign OS](https://www.lepoint.fr/high-tech-internet/un-os-souverain-est-il-possible-15-02-2016-2017965_47.php), emphasizing the importance of building on a solid, open-source Linux foundation rather than creating an entirely new system. Batho envisioned a sovereign, democratic OS that would form the basis for a "mutualized, collaborative digital ecosystem," accessible and trusted by both citizens and businesses. She argued that France should prioritize:

1. **Protection of Individual Freedoms**: A sovereign OS could safeguard personal liberties from foreign-controlled tech infrastructures that are often opaque about data usage.

2. **National Security**: Batho highlighted the importance of a self-reliant digital infrastructure, which would limit France’s dependency on foreign software systems.

3. **Economic Autonomy**: She expressed concern over the dominance of global tech monopolies, warning that without a sovereign digital infrastructure, France and Europe would remain vulnerable to the economic siphoning caused by big data giants operating under foreign laws.

Batho’s approach pointed to the advantages of using open-source software, advocating for transparency, adaptability, and collective trust. A Linux-based sovereign OS could allow France to operate independently while still being open to collaborative development—a pragmatic alternative to total dependence on foreign technology.

### Criticism and Skepticism: A Missed Opportunity for Constructive Dialogue

The 2016 proposal was met with notable resistance from [some technologists and digital liberties advocates](https://www.bortzmeyer.org/os-souverain.html), who viewed it as ambitious but flawed. Critics cited the lack of technical definitions and feared that it was an impractical endeavor requiring resources comparable to those of large tech companies. Additionally, some questioned whether France was prepared to manage the substantial budget and technical expertise such a project would require.

Moreover, critics speculated that the OS would not be trusted by the public, fearing it might facilitate **state surveillance**. The lack of clarity around the proposal’s ultimate purpose—whether it was for citizen privacy or government oversight—caused some to dismiss it as a politically driven buzzword. Unfortunately, this reaction overlooked the clear intent to adapt Linux, not to build from scratch. Many critics missed an opportunity to emphasize the positive aspects of a sovereign OS, including the potential to build on successful open-source projects like Debian or Replicant, which would be technically feasible and aligned with public interests.

### The Example of Mandrakesoft/Mandriva: An Overlooked Opportunity for Digital Sovereignty

France’s ambition for a sovereign OS is not without precedent. The rise and fall of Mandrakesoft, later **Mandriva**, serves as a cautionary tale. As a pioneering French Linux distribution, Mandriva demonstrated the potential for a successful open-source ecosystem but ultimately went bankrupt, partially due to a lack of consistent government support. Had Mandriva received the backing it needed, it might have provided a strong foundation for a sovereign OS project and a domestic open-source community. This missed opportunity underscores the importance of sustained investment in local open-source initiatives, which are crucial to achieving long-term digital sovereignty.

### A Constructive Perspective: The Case for a Pragmatic Approach to Digital Sovereignty

Despite past criticisms, a sovereign OS remains a viable path for France to enhance its digital autonomy and privacy protections. When framed constructively, the initiative aligns with broader European goals, addressing the influence of American tech giants, data control, and national security.

1. **Building on Existing Open-Source Solutions**: By leveraging established Linux distributions like Debian or Replicant, France could customize a sovereign OS that meets national security standards and privacy laws without incurring the costs of proprietary software. This approach offers a feasible and economically sound way to ensure digital sovereignty.

2. **Promoting Transparency and Collaboration**: An open-source OS supports transparency, allowing citizens and experts to inspect and improve the code, building public trust in the system. Open-source projects foster adaptability, enabling swift responses to new cybersecurity challenges without sacrificing user privacy.

3. **Economic and Educational Impact**: Adopting an open-source sovereign OS would stimulate the local tech sector, create job opportunities, and enhance IT skills. A focus on open-source in public administration could reallocate licensing costs to foster innovation and support the growth of French IT expertise, contributing to a resilient and self-reliant digital economy.

4. **Alignment with European Digital Sovereignty Goals**: France’s ambitions for a sovereign OS align closely with EU-wide objectives, such as the EU-Linux initiative. A cooperative European approach to digital sovereignty would amplify resources and create a unified digital framework that can effectively counterbalance the influence of non-European tech giants.

### Renewed Push: The 2023 Sovereign OS Proposal

In 2023, the call for a sovereign French OS resurfaced amid heightened concerns over data confidentiality and digital autonomy. **Senators Pierre Ouzoulias and Marie-Noëlle Lienemann** [proposed a rigorous action plan](https://www.numerama.com/politique/1437188-le-systeme-dexploitation-francais-ressurgit-au-senat.html), calling on the government to develop and deploy a national operating system for public administrations, from computers to smartphones, within a year of the legislation’s adoption. The proposal emphasized:

- **Comprehensive Scope**: The OS would extend across all public administration devices, ensuring sovereignty over data managed by government employees. With American OS options—Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS—dominating the computer sector (93% market share) and Android and iOS controlling nearly 99% of the smartphone market, the French government expressed growing unease over its digital dependency on foreign entities.

- **Enhanced Sovereignty and Security**: The senators highlighted that current OS alternatives fail to address the level of confidentiality required for public work. The widespread adoption of an independent OS would mitigate risks associated with third-party data collection and surveillance.

This new proposal reflects the mounting recognition of an OS as more than a utility—it is the central orchestrator of digital activities, responsible for managing resources, enabling interaction, and coordinating system functions. The reliance on foreign-developed OSs for core operations of public administration reflects, as the senators articulated, “**a loss of digital sovereignty in favor of the United States**.”

### Final Thoughts: A European Initiative for a Sovereign, Linux-Based OS

The history of France’s ambition for a sovereign operating system reveals the need for a clear, pragmatic strategy grounded in transparency and collaboration. Learning from past efforts, including both successes and setbacks like the story of Mandriva, it is evident that **an EU-backed initiative to support the development of a Linux-based OS** for public administration, encompassing both PCs and handheld devices, should be seriously considered and initiated.

This initiative could draw from **existing Linux-based technologies**, leveraging open-source flexibility to create a secure, privacy-focused ecosystem that can evolve with changing security and interoperability requirements. A collaborative European approach would ensure pooled resources, greater innovation, and alignment with shared regulatory standards such as GDPR. By working within the open-source community, the EU could customize an OS that meets national security needs, promotes digital sovereignty, and ensures public trust through full code transparency.

Such a strategy is not only feasible but also advantageous for EU Member States. Through **constructive engagement** and **coordinated investment**, a European sovereign OS could enhance digital independence and resilience across the continent. This initiative would establish a practical, secure, and open system that strengthens Europe’s role in the digital world, setting a model of autonomy, transparency, and innovation for both citizens and government alike.

- **SLA for Ongoing Maintenance**: Define clear Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for patch management, security updates, and support, ensuring timely response to security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues.
- **EU-Specific Repository and Update Infrastructure**: Require the creation of a dedicated EU repository for updates, ensuring control over software sources and minimizing reliance on external providers.
- **Transition to In-House Maintenance Option**: Plan for a potential transfer of responsibilities to EU in-house teams or community-driven maintenance after an initial support period (e.g., 5-10 years).

##### Build Community and Stakeholder Engagement

- **Open-Source Community Involvement**: Encourage the selected vendor to actively collaborate with existing open-source communities and provide a mechanism for external contributions.
- **Feedback Channels**: Establish feedback mechanisms for end-users in public administration to suggest improvements, report issues, and share best practices.
- **Engagement with Member States**: Involve Member State IT departments throughout the process, fostering alignment and buy-in.

#### Potential Pitfalls and Mitigation Strategies

##### 1. Lack of EU Control Over Key Features and Development Decisions

- **Pitfall**: Without direct involvement, the EU may lack influence over important decisions related to privacy, security, or compliance.
- **Mitigation**:
    - **Detailed Specifications**: Clearly define privacy and security requirements and avoid ambiguity in specifications.
    - **Contractual Safeguards**: Include strict contractual terms requiring adherence to specifications and allowing the EU oversight committee to approve or reject significant decisions.
    - **Source Code Access and Transparency**: Ensure full access to source code, configuration files, and build systems, allowing independent verification and audits by the EU or third-party experts.

##### 2. Vendor Lock-In

- **Pitfall**: Relying on a single vendor could create dependency issues, especially if the vendor has proprietary modifications that complicate future updates or transitions.
- **Mitigation**:
    - **Open-Source Commitment**: Require all developed code, configurations, and patches to be licensed under a compatible open-source license.
    - **Documentation Requirements**: Mandate comprehensive documentation for all configurations, processes, and deployment scripts, ensuring future maintainability.
    - **In-House Transition Clause**: Include a clause allowing the EU to transition maintenance to in-house teams or an open-source community after the initial contract period.

##### 3. Compliance and Security Risks

- **Pitfall**: The outsourced distribution may not meet the stringent GDPR, security, or reproducibility requirements of public administrations.
- **Mitigation**:
    - **Regular Security Audits**: Contract periodic third-party security audits and source code reviews to identify vulnerabilities or compliance issues.
    - **Reproducibility and Auditability**: Require a declarative configuration model (e.g., using Nix) that allows systems to be exactly reproduced, simplifying audits.
    - **EU-Based Data Handling**: Mandate that any data handling infrastructure used in development or support is based in the EU to maintain compliance with GDPR.

##### 4. Lack of Community and Ecosystem Buy-In

- **Pitfall**: If the project lacks integration with existing open-source communities, it may suffer from limited support, slower innovation, and community fragmentation.
- **Mitigation**:
    - **Community Contributions**: Encourage the vendor to actively contribute upstream to the projects they rely on, fostering goodwill and integration with the wider open-source community.
    - **EU Linux Community Engagement Program**: Establish a program to connect the project with the European open-source community, encouraging feedback and external contributions.
    - **Transparency of Development**: Publish development progress and allow community reviews of new features or changes, fostering trust and engagement.

##### 5. Inconsistent User Experience and Support Across Member States

- **Pitfall**: A lack of standardized support and updates may lead to fragmented experiences, with some Member States encountering support delays or incompatibilities.
- **Mitigation**:
     - **Centralized Support Infrastructure**: Require the vendor to establish a central support and update infrastructure accessible to all Member States.
     - **Standardized Training Materials**: Mandate multilingual training materials, consistent support practices, and onboarding resources to ensure uniform user experiences.
     - **Local Customization Support**: Specify a process for Member States to customize the system for unique requirements without diverging from core updates.

##### 6. Inflexibility in Adapting to Future Requirements

- **Pitfall**: Once delivered, the outsourced distribution may struggle to adapt to changing EU policy, technology, or security requirements.
- **Mitigation**:
    - **Modular and Configurable Design**: Specify that the system architecture must be modular, allowing future additions or modifications without extensive rework.
    - **Future-Proofing Requirements**: Include contractual clauses requiring the vendor to provide updates aligned with future EU technology or security policies.
    - **Long-Term Development Roadmap**: Define a roadmap that includes anticipated improvements, allowing the EU and vendor to plan and allocate resources for upcoming changes.
