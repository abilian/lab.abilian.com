## Context

https://www.europarl.europa.eu/petitions/fr/petition/content/0729%252F2024/html/Petition-Nr.%25C2%25A00729%252F2024%252C-eingereicht-von-N.%25C2%25A0W.%252C-%25C3%25B6sterreichischer-Staatsangeh%25C3%25B6rigkeit%252C-zur-Einf%25C3%25BChrung-eines-EU-Linux-Betriebssystems-in-den-%25C3%25B6ffentlichen-Verwaltungen-aller-EU-Mitgliedstaaten

The petitioner calls for the European Union to actively develop and implement a Linux-based operating system, termed ‘EU-Linux’, across public administrations in all EU Member States. This initiative aims to reduce dependency on Microsoft products, ensuring compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and promoting transparency, sustainability, and digital sovereignty within the EU. The petitioner emphasizes the importance of using open-source alternatives to Microsoft 365, such as LibreOffice and Nextcloud, and suggests the adoption of the E/OS mobile operating system for government devices. The petitioner also highlights the potential for job creation in the IT sector through this initiative.

## Pitch

Here’s why endorsing this petition is essential:

### Feasibility and Readiness

Linux is not a fledgling idea—it is a mature, highly adaptable operating system used in countless environments worldwide, from data centers to personal devices. Unlike proprietary solutions, Linux's **modular architecture** and **open-source nature** allow it to be tailored to meet specific regulatory and operational requirements across EU member states. The open-source ecosystem around Linux enables rapid bug fixing and feature improvements, ensuring a robust and continuously enhanced platform. With a vast choice of Linux distributions, each tailored to different use cases, the EU has an opportunity to select or customize an iteration that perfectly aligns with the distinct needs of public administration.

### Economic Impact

The financial benefits of adopting Linux across EU administrations are compelling. By moving away from costly proprietary licenses, the EU could see immediate reductions in licensing expenses, allowing those funds to be redirected toward innovation and improvement. The open-source model not only reduces maintenance costs but also ensures that each member state can customize the system without incurring exorbitant fees. Furthermore, developing an EU-centric Linux distribution would **stimulate the European IT industry**, creating jobs and fostering a vibrant, competitive market for digital services. This move towards a unified digital infrastructure would enable more efficient interoperability, streamlining collaboration across national borders and making the EU more cohesive in its digital initiatives.

### Security and Compliance

One of the most critical aspects of public sector digital infrastructure is security. Unlike proprietary operating systems, which are often vulnerable to opaque practices, Linux’s open-source foundation means that its code is fully **transparent** and **auditable**. This transparency allows security experts to proactively identify and patch vulnerabilities, ensuring a resilient platform that can rapidly adapt to evolving cyber threats. By reducing dependence on proprietary software, the EU would also decrease its attack surface, enhancing overall cybersecurity. Moreover, Linux’s architecture aligns with stringent security standards, making it an ideal choice for governmental institutions that operate under strict compliance requirements.

### Interoperability and Flexibility

Linux excels in supporting **open standards**, which is essential for public administration systems that must interact with a wide variety of technologies and services. Its support for virtualization and diverse network services enables seamless integration into existing IT landscapes, making it easier for different government agencies to communicate and share resources securely. This interoperability fosters a cohesive digital ecosystem within the EU, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of cross-border collaborations.

### Digital Sovereignty and Privacy

Adopting Linux across public institutions is a powerful move towards **digital sovereignty**, reducing the EU's reliance on foreign, proprietary software from the US or China. By exercising some level of control on the source code, the EU can ensure the highest levels of data privacy and protect sensitive information from potential foreign interference. Linux not only enables compliance with EU-specific privacy standards like GDPR but also puts data ownership directly in the hands of EU citizens, building public trust in digital governance.

### Innovation and Education

Open-source systems like Linux are not just cost-effective; they are also **platforms for innovation**. Implementing an EU-wide Linux operating system would provide a foundation upon which to build new, innovative applications and services tailored to public needs. Beyond government operations, Linux is a popular tool in educational institutions, where it is used to teach students essential IT skills. As future generations grow accustomed to Linux, the EU can cultivate a skilled workforce proficient in open-source technology, further boosting Europe's digital competitiveness.

### A Vision Beyond Risk Mitigation

While it is crucial to address cybersecurity risks, the true value of an open-source solution like Linux lies in the **opportunity for growth, collaboration, and competitive advantage**. Open-source ecosystems encourage cooperation between diverse teams and organizations, driving faster innovation than isolated, proprietary models. We can see this principle in action within sectors like the automotive industry, where open-source interoperability has revolutionized collaboration between manufacturers and suppliers. By fostering a Linux-based ecosystem, the EU can create similar opportunities for digital collaboration across member states, allowing each country to contribute to a shared digital framework while tailoring it to local needs.

### A Call to Action

Supporting this petition is not merely about adopting an operating system; it’s a commitment to a **new paradigm of digital governance** for the EU—one that values sovereignty, economic strength, transparency, and innovation. By uniting behind EU-Linux, we pave the way for a resilient, cost-effective, and open digital ecosystem that aligns with European values and standards. This initiative offers a clear opportunity to strengthen the EU’s digital infrastructure, making it a beacon for digital sovereignty and innovation in a globalized world. Sign the petition and join the movement for a forward-thinking, sovereign digital Europe.
