Here are some common questions (FAQ) about open source development:

## Generic Questions (and Answers)

1.  **What is free software and open source?** Free software and open source are closely related concepts that focus on the freedom to use, study, share, and modify software. They involve licensing (e.g., GPL), principles (e.g., FSF), and definitions that encompass software, content, hardware, and services. The distinction between product and process is crucial, as it determines the nature of the project and how low-cost integration is supported.
    
2.  **Is open-source software (OSS) useful?** OSS is beneficial for individuals, society, and both. It enables innovation, collaboration, and cost-effective solutions while promoting transparency and the sharing of knowledge.
    
3.  **Why are people engaged in OSS**, and what are the incentives? People engage in OSS for various reasons, such as learning, reputation, or contributing to a cause. Reducing frictions (legal, social, market, and technological) can help remove barriers and foster participation.
    
4.  **Is OSS innovative?** While OSS may not always result in radical changes, it supports incremental and slow innovations. OSS can be seen as a stabilizing force that ensures software works well. The innovations can be user-perceived (e.g., text to GUI), developer-based (e.g., code or algorithms), or process-oriented (e.g., organization of work).
    
5.  **What are the commons?** The commons refer to resources that are not owned by anyone and can be accessed and used on equivalent terms. Scholars like Yochai Benkler and Lawrence Lessig have contributed to the understanding of the commons in the context of OSS.
    
6.  **What is peer-production?** Peer-production is a collaborative model of production where the organization is not based on price or management hierarchy. The term emphasizes the importance of the peer element in the production process.
    
7.  **What is the integration mechanism in Commons-Based Peer Production (CBPP)?** The integration mechanism allows various distributed contributions to come together and contribute to the commons. It involves understanding the costs and barriers for CBPP and the benefits of integration.
    
8.  **When can we have CBPP?** CBPP occurs when there is an environment that supports collaboration, knowledge sharing, and low-cost integration. It is more likely to thrive when legal, social, and technological barriers are minimized, and there is a strong community-driven approach to problem-solving and innovation.
