In "After Babel: The False Promise of Device-Based Education," Amy Tyson, along with insights from Jon Haidt and Zach Rausch, argues that the widespread adoption of digital devices in education—like smartphones, tablets, and EdTech—has not delivered on its promises and may even be detrimental to student development. Tyson co-founded Everyschool, aiming to counter the uncritical embrace of screens in schools and to promote digital wellness—a concept focused on using technology in ways that support mental, physical, and social well-being rather than undermine them.

Tyson critiques the overuse of screens in educational settings, which began in earnest in the early 2010s, coinciding with a decline in academic performance and an increase in youth mental health issues. She identifies major myths perpetuating screen overuse in schools:

1. **EdTech Improves Learning**: Tyson challenges the assumption that EdTech enhances student learning, noting a lack of independent evidence supporting its effectiveness over traditional methods. She points out that academic performance has declined even as EdTech has become pervasive.

2. **Delivery Method Is Neutral**: Tyson argues that screens are not merely neutral tools but can detract from learning by fostering distraction and weakening engagement. She illustrates how digital gaming and reward-based EdTech apps often prioritize engagement metrics over educational substance, potentially impairing students' focus and resilience.

3. **Tech Prepares Students for the Future**: Tyson warns that the emphasis on screen-based learning may undermine essential "soft skills" such as critical thinking, collaboration, and self-control. These foundational skills are crucial for adapting to future technology and job markets.

4. **Devices Engage Students**: Tyson contends that while screens may capture attention, they do not foster meaningful engagement with learning. Instead, real-world interactions and traditional activities foster deeper connections and sustained interest, as demonstrated in Waldorf schools that limit screen use.

5. **Technology Fosters Connection**: Tyson highlights the paradox of increased digital communication but declining social connectedness among students. She notes that face-to-face interaction fosters a stronger sense of belonging and community, which screens cannot replicate.

Tyson and Everyschool advocate for a more selective and developmental approach to technology in education, outlined in their models like the [EdTech Triangle](https://www.everyschool.org/the-edtech-triangle) and the R.E.A.C.H. framework. These models emphasize removing weak or excessive tech, embracing tech that genuinely enhances learning, and promoting a focus on human connection. Tyson stresses that schools need clear, research-based tech policies and recommends reducing screen time, especially for younger students, to mitigate the negative impacts on focus, social skills, and mental health.
