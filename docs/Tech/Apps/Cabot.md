## Notes
Main repo is unmaintained / still on Python2.7 & ancient Django version.

Most recent forks (?):
- https://github.com/dagelf/cabot
- https://github.com/clouetb/cabot

But both are not in good shape (better that the orig, though).

And also: https://github.com/cabotapp (same)

Todo: run it in ~ghq/github.com/cabotapp/docker-cabot
