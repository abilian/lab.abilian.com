Collabora Online is a robust, supported suite for self-hosted collaboration, while CODE is an easy entry point to experience and develop with it:

**Collabora Online** is a powerful, open-source, enterprise-ready online office suite. Based on LibreOffice technology, it enables real-time collaborative editing of documents, spreadsheets, and presentations directly in a web browser. It's designed for integration into other platforms (like Nextcloud, ownCloud, etc.), giving organizations control over their documents and data.

**CODE (Collabora Online Development Edition)** is essentially the free, community-supported version of Collabora Online. It's perfect for developers, home users, or small teams to easily test, evaluate, or develop integrations with Collabora Online. While not intended for large-scale production deployments (which Collabora Online handles), CODE provides the full feature set for testing and development, often distributed as an easy-to-use Docker image.
