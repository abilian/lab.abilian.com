"One assertion per test" is the sort of thing you teach TDD beginners, as a crutch, but it's not a good universal rule. You should test one concept per test, one rule, one unit of behaviour. Sometimes that concept is better expressed with more than assertion. (https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes/status/1752236595091054671)
