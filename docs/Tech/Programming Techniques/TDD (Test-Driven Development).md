Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the production code itself. TDD can work effectively under several conditions, which correlate with the desired outcomes you've listed.

## Conditions Favorable for TDD

1. **Clear Requirements:** TDD works well when the requirements are well-understood and can be broken down into specific functionalities with predictable inputs and outputs.

2. **Incremental Development:** TDD is suited to an iterative development process where features are built and extended incrementally, allowing tests to be written for small units of code at a time.

3. **Refactoring Culture:** TDD thrives in environments where refactoring is a continuous practice, enabling the codebase to evolve while ensuring that the changes do not break existing functionality.

4. **Team Discipline:** A team that is disciplined in maintaining a consistent TDD practice will likely reap more benefits, as TDD requires a consistent approach to writing and maintaining tests.

5. **Automated Testing Environment:** TDD requires an automated testing environment where tests can be run quickly and frequently.

6. **Design for Testability:** The system needs to be designed in a way that is amenable to testing, meaning that the architecture supports the isolation of components for testing purposes.

7. **Understanding of Testing Techniques:** Developers must have a good grasp of testing techniques, such as mocking and stubbing, to effectively isolate units for testing.

## When TDD Might Not Work

- **Exploratory Domains:** In areas where the solution or output is not known in advance, such as data science or exploratory research, TDD might be less effective.
  
- **Complex Integration:** In systems where outcomes are heavily dependent on complex integrations that cannot be easily replicated or isolated in tests.

- **Performance-Critical Systems:** For systems where performance is a critical aspect, TDD might introduce challenges, as the overhead of tests and mocks can obscure performance bottlenecks.

- **Non-Deterministic Outcomes:** Systems that rely on or produce non-deterministic outcomes may not be suitable for TDD.

- **High-Cost Setup:** If setting up the test environment is extremely costly or time-consuming, TDD might not be practical.

## Meeting Outcomes with Alternative Approaches

If TDD isn't suitable but the desired outcomes are still valued, alternative approaches could be:

- **Behavior-Driven Development ([[BDD]]):** This focuses on the behavior of the system from the user's perspective and might be more suitable for systems with complex user interactions.

- **Integration Testing:** In cases where micro-tests do not effectively predict macro-behavior, a focus on integration or system-level testing might be warranted.

- **Monitoring and Observability:** In systems with emergent properties, investing in strong monitoring and observability can help maintain reliability.

- **Code Reviews and Pair Programming:** To ensure responsibility and communication of thought processes, rigorous code reviews and pair programming practices can be beneficial.

## Summary 

TDD is a powerful practice under the right conditions, but it's not a silver bullet. It's essential to evaluate the nature of the project, the team's skills, and the system's architecture before committing to a TDD workflow or seeking alternatives that align better with the project's needs and desired outcomes.
