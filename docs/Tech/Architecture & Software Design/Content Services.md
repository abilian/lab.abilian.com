**While many nonprofit organizations and government agencies use traditional enterprise content management (ECM) to manage and leverage content, this approach is limited by a centralized platform and does not address the need for agility and integration in a fast-changing digital landscape. This is where** **_content services_****, a relatively-new concept in the world of content management, comes into play.**

Content services, a term developed by Gartner in 2016, represents a shift from self-contained systems and repositories to open services. As described in their 2017 report [What You Need to Know About Content Services Platforms](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3664418): “Content services are a set of services and microservices, embodied either as an integrated product suite or as separate applications that share common APIs and repositories, to exploit diverse content types and to serve multiple constituencies and numerous use cases across an organization.”

A content service platform (CSP) leverages new technologies to effectively and efficiently access, share, prioritize, and preserve content to drive higher engagement, collaboration, and satisfaction and grow new and existing opportunities to achieve organizational goals. And usage is its main attraction of a CSP, as opposed to ECM is which storage; a CSP is able to leverage content across multiple repositories to connect dissimilar applications within an organization’s [digital ecosystem](https://www.forumone.com/ideas/mapping-your-digital-ecosystem/), as opposed to ECM, which operates within a single platform. In the commercial sector, larger companies such as Walmart and Amazon have moved to content services platforms. For example, Walmart uses CSP for content management, as well as for analytics and content distribution and delivery.
