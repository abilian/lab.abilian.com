Using service classes in software development can help with on readability, maintainability, scalability, and testability.

Here are some of the key points to remembers:

1. **Introduction**

   - Motivation for using service classes to encapsulate business logic.
   - Disclaimer about language independence and simplicity of examples.

1. **Service Pattern Clarification**

   - Definition and purpose of a service class in the context of encapsulating business logic.
   - Distinction from other architectural patterns and focus on readability and maintainability over framework abstraction.

1. **Core Best Practices**

   - **Public “process” method**: Implementing a single entry-point to enhance clarity and accessibility for new developers and non-technical domain experts.
   - **Mark internal methods as “protected”**: Improving code interaction and readability by clearly indicating non-public methods.
   - **Keep the context outside**: Ensuring testability and framework independence by minimizing dependencies on external contexts, such as web requests.

1. **Structural Guidelines**

   - **Pass required parameters via the constructor**: Streamlining service usage and enhancing clarity by avoiding clutter in the process method.
   - **Limit write access to class attributes**: Maintaining simplicity and reducing unintended side-effects by restricting where class attributes can be modified.
   - **Avoid class attributes if possible**: Encouraging local scope over global to simplify data flow and debugging.
   - **Try to avoid optional parameters and flags**: Simplifying logic and reducing complexity by minimizing branching and potential outcomes.

1. **Coding Practices for Clarity and Maintainability**

   - **Limit your services depth**: Avoiding deep nesting of method calls to keep the logic straightforward and understandable.
   - **Use docstrings and inline comments**: Providing context and explanations to help future developers understand the purpose and implementation details.
   - **Explain obscure or innovative implementations**: Documenting the rationale behind non-obvious code choices to facilitate future maintenance and refactoring.

1. **Advanced Structuring Techniques**

   - **Use mixins for inheritance**: Leveraging mixins to avoid code duplication and enhance reusability without the overhead of full inheritance.
   - **Keep your methods short**: Striving for concise methods to improve readability and manageability.

1. **Coding Enhancements**

   - **Use type-hinting**: Increasing code clarity and aiding debugging by specifying expected data types.
   - **DRY is about knowledge, not code**: Distinguishing between code reuse and the encapsulation of business knowledge to avoid semantic dilution.

1. **Alternative Strategies**

   - Finite state machines (FSM) as a pattern for implementing business flows
   - BPM / BPMN
