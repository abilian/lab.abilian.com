When considering alternatives to microservices, several architectural patterns and approaches can be applied based on the needs of a system, organization, and team dynamics. Each alternative has its strengths and weaknesses, depending on the scalability, complexity, and organisational and operational demands of the system being built.

Here are the primary alternatives, with real-world examples illustrating their usage.

### Monolithic Architecture

- **Overview**: In a monolithic architecture, all components of an application (UI, business logic, database access) are combined into a single, unified system. It typically involves one large codebase and a single deployable artifact.
- **Strengths**:
  - Simplicity: Easier to develop, test, deploy, and maintain in the early stages.
  - Performance: No network latency between services, as all components communicate in-process.
  - Lower Overhead: Less operational complexity, with simpler deployment pipelines and no need to manage service-to-service communication.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Scaling: Harder to scale individual components. Scaling requires scaling the whole system, even if only part of the system needs additional resources.
  - Deployment: In large teams, monoliths can create deployment bottlenecks, as everyone must synchronize changes and deploy at once.
  - Flexibility: Different components of a monolith must use the same technology stack, limiting the flexibility to adopt newer technologies.
- **Example**: **Basecamp**
  - **Use Case**: Basecamp, a project management tool, initially built its platform using a monolithic Ruby on Rails application. This setup enabled rapid development, simpler deployments, and a cohesive structure for a small team.
  - **Why It Works**: For a small team managing a stable product, a monolith allowed Basecamp to focus on building features rather than managing complex service interactions. The simplicity of the monolith suited their team size and user base.

### Modular Monolith ([[Modulith]])

- **Overview**: A modular monolith is a monolithic architecture where the internal components are designed to be modular, typically using clear boundaries between business domains (e.g., through well-defined APIs or libraries).
- **Strengths**:
  - Clean code structure: Modular boundaries within the monolith help in managing complexity and organizing teams.
  - Easier Refactoring: Modular monoliths can later evolve into microservices if needed, with less friction.
  - Simplified Operations: Benefits of monolithic operations while enabling a more organized codebase with clearly separated concerns.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Scaling limitations: Like monoliths, the entire application is still deployed as a single unit, making horizontal scaling difficult.
  - Limited Fault Isolation: A failure in one module can affect the entire system.
- **Example**: **Shopify**
  - **Use Case**: Shopify, an e-commerce platform, adopted a modular monolithic architecture for its Ruby on Rails application. It organized the platform into well-separated modules representing different business domains (such as checkout, inventory, payments).
  - **Why It Works**: Shopify needed a balance between the simplicity of a monolith and the scalability of microservices. By modularizing the monolith, Shopify could deploy faster and manage complexity while still enjoying the benefits of monolithic deployments.

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

- **Overview**: SOA is the precursor to microservices and focuses on building applications as a set of loosely coupled services that communicate over a network, typically with a message bus. Services are larger than microservices and generally represent business units.
- **Strengths**:
  - Reusability: Services can be reused across different parts of the system or even across applications.
  - Modularity: Similar to microservices, SOA allows modular development but with fewer, larger services.
  - Technology Independence: Each service can use its own technology stack.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Complexity: Like microservices, SOA requires network-based communication between services, which introduces latency, complexity in deployment, and coordination.
  - Performance Overhead: The communication between services can be slower than in-process calls.
- **Example**: **eBay**
  - **Use Case**: eBay adopted service-oriented architecture (SOA) in the early 2000s. It broke its platform into a set of services (like search, payments, and inventory management) that interacted over a message bus.
  - **Why It Works**: SOA allowed eBay to scale its services independently as the user base grew. This modular approach made it easier to manage updates, improve fault tolerance, and reuse services across different parts of the platform.

### Serverless Architecture

- **Overview**: Serverless architecture (also known as Function-as-a-Service or FaaS) involves breaking down applications into individual functions that are executed in response to events. The infrastructure is managed by a cloud provider, and the developer focuses solely on writing the business logic.
- **Strengths**:
  - No Infrastructure Management: Scaling, provisioning, and infrastructure concerns are managed by the cloud provider.
  - Cost Efficiency: Pay only for actual usage, with automatic scaling.
  - Quick Iteration: Functions are independently deployable, enabling rapid updates and experimentation.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Cold Start Latency: Functions can experience startup latency, which affects performance.
  - Vendor Lock-in: Serverless is often tied to cloud providers, leading to potential lock-in.
  - Statelessness: Functions are typically stateless, so managing state between invocations can be challenging.
- **Example**: **Netflix (Data Pipelines)**
  - **Use Case**: Netflix uses AWS Lambda, a serverless computing service, to run data processing pipelines such as real-time video encoding and metadata processing.
  - **Why It Works**: Netflix's data pipelines require high scalability and on-demand execution, making serverless architecture ideal. With Lambda, Netflix doesn't need to manage servers, and it only pays for the actual compute time used.

### Micro-Frontend Architecture

- **Overview**: Micro-frontends extend the microservices concept to the frontend, breaking the user interface into small, independently deployable parts. Each micro-frontend corresponds to a specific business domain and communicates with backend microservices or APIs.
- **Strengths**:
  - Independence: Teams can work on different parts of the frontend in isolation.
  - Independent Deployments: Each micro-frontend can be deployed independently, allowing for faster release cycles.
  - Technology Flexibility: Different micro-frontends can use different frontend technologies.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Complexity: Managing multiple frontend applications adds complexity, particularly around integration and user experience consistency.
  - Performance Overhead: Multiple frontend components can lead to increased load times and resource consumption on the client side.
- **Example**: **IKEA (E-commerce Frontend)**
  - **Use Case**: IKEA transitioned its e-commerce frontend into micro-frontends, where different parts of the website (like product search, shopping cart, and user profiles) are built and deployed independently by different teams.
  - **Why It Works**: By breaking the frontend into smaller, independent units, IKEA allows its teams to work autonomously on various parts of the user interface, enabling faster updates and diverse technology stacks.

### Hybrid Architecture

- **Overview**: Hybrid architectures combine monolithic and microservices approaches, where part of the system remains monolithic, and specific components are broken out as microservices.
- **Strengths**:
  - Flexibility: Allows teams to decide which parts of the system benefit from microservices without fully adopting the approach.
  - Simplified Operations: You can maintain simplicity in parts of the application while using microservices where truly needed.
  - Incremental Adoption: Teams can gradually transition to microservices without the need for an immediate large-scale migration.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Complexity: Balancing between the two architectures can introduce challenges in deployment and communication between the monolithic parts and microservices.
  - Inconsistent Design: It may be harder to maintain architectural consistency when combining two approaches.
- **Example**: **Twitter**
  - **Use Case**: Twitter started as a monolithic Ruby on Rails application but transitioned to a hybrid architecture. It broke out specific services (such as tweet handling) into microservices while keeping others in a monolithic structure.
  - **Why It Works**: Twitter needed to scale critical services independently, like handling massive tweet volumes, without fully adopting microservices for all parts of the system.

### Component-Based Architecture

- **Overview**: In component-based architecture, applications are built from modular, reusable components, typically adhering to the principles of clean architecture or hexagonal architecture. The components are not fully independent services but are structured for internal modularity within a single system.
- **Strengths**:
  - Internal Modularity: Improves maintainability and flexibility without the need for network communication.
  - Easier Refactoring: Components can be refactored or replaced more easily than traditional monolithic modules.
  - Lower Complexity: No inter-process communication, making it easier to maintain than microservices.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Lack of Deployment Independence: Components are still deployed together, limiting team autonomy and scaling granularity.
  - Scaling Limits: Scaling individual components is not as easy as with microservices.
- **Example**: **JetBrains (IntelliJ IDEA)**
  - **Use Case**: JetBrains developed IntelliJ IDEA, an IDE, using a component-based architecture. The platform consists of well-defined, modular components (such as code editor, debugger, and version control) that interact internally but are not deployed independently. Same for the Eclipse Platform.
  - **Why It Works**: IntelliJ benefits from internal modularity without the complexity of managing separate services. The clean separation of components improves maintainability, allowing the JetBrains team to update or refactor parts of the system independently.

## Which one is "better"?

Each approach provides a distinct set of trade-offs, and choosing one depends on your team size, system complexity, and scalability needs:

1. **Monolithic**: Best for smaller teams or simpler systems, focusing on operational simplicity.
1. **Modular Monolith**: Provides internal modularity without full microservices, allowing for cleaner code and easier refactoring.
1. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Suited for large enterprises with distinct business units needing independent services but not the granularity of microservices.
1. **Serverless**: Ideal for event-driven systems or highly variable workloads where managing servers should be minimized.
1. **Micro-Frontend**: Useful for large-scale web applications with multiple teams working on different parts of the UI.
1. **Hybrid**: Balances monoliths and microservices, allowing critical services to scale while maintaining simplicity.
1. **Component-Based**: Focuses on internal modularity, ensuring that the codebase is manageable and flexible without needing distributed services.

The key to selecting the right architecture is understanding the business, technical, and organisational requirements and balancing complexity, cost, and scalability.
