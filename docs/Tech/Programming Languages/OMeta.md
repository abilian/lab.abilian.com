Ometa is an object-oriented programming language and a pattern-matching system based on Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs), designed to unify parsing, tree manipulation, and code generation. It allows developers to define grammars that can both recognize input streams (like text, token streams, or even arbitrary object graphs) and, upon a successful match, construct new data structures or perform actions. This makes Ometa particularly well-suited for tasks such as creating compilers, interpreters, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and tools for manipulating structured data, by providing a powerful and expressive way to describe and transform complex patterns.
