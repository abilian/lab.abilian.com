### The "4doc" / Diátaxis model

- https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/problems-with-the-4doc-model/
- https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/
- https://diataxis.fr/

"The core idea of Diátaxis is that there are fundamentally four identifiable kinds of documentation, that respond to four different needs. The four kinds are: _tutorials_, _how-to guides_, _reference_ and _explanation_. Each has a different purpose, and needs to be written in a different way."

### The Seven Action model

- https://passo.uno/seven-action-model/

The Seven-Action Model is based on seven actions that users typically perform when interacting with documentation:

1. **Appraise (Discern):** Evaluating the product's qualities and comparing it to others.
2. **Understand (Learn):** Grasping the fundamental concepts behind the product.
3. **Explore (Discover):** Experimenting with the product and discovering its features.
4. **Practice (Train):** Learning how to perform specific tasks.
5. **Remember (Recall):** Looking up specific information, like parameters or error codes.
6. **Develop (Integrate):** Building upon or extending the product's functionality.
7. **Troubleshoot (Solve):** Diagnosing and resolving issues.

## Norms

- [[ISO 16016]] - specifies the protection notices which serve to prevent the improper use of documents and products whose usage is restricted.
