## Description
Wapiti allows you to audit the security of your websites or web applications.

It performs "black-box" scans (it does not study the source code) of the web application by crawling the webpages of the deployed webapp, looking for scripts and forms where it can inject data.

## Installation
Very easy: `pipx install wapiti3`
