1. **Engineering Practices & Team Dynamics:**
    
    - Small engineering teams can produce high-quality products.
    - Simple solutions often outperform clever, over-engineered ones.
    - Quick turnarounds on fixing vulnerabilities usually correlate with overall engineering excellence.
    - There's always at least one closet security enthusiast among the software engineers.
    
1. **Security Audit Observations & Techniques:**
    
    - Highest impact findings come early and late in the audit process.
    - Monorepos are easier to audit than multi-repos.
    - Custom fuzzing techniques can be surprisingly effective.
    - Acquisitions introduce complexity in security audits.

1. **Trends in Software Security & Development:**
    
    - Secure coding practices have improved over the last decade.
    - Secure-by-default features in modern frameworks have significantly improved security.
    - Business logic flaws, while rare, can be devastating.
    - Dependency libraries introduce a significant security challenge.

1. **Common Vulnerabilities & Misconceptions:**
    
    - The most severe security vulnerabilities are often glaringly obvious.
    - Deserialization of untrusted data is a major risk.
    - JWT tokens and webhooks are frequently misconfigured.
    - MD5 is still in use, but often not for security-critical tasks.

1. **Impact & Exploitation Considerations:**
    
    - Discoverability is a crucial factor in assessing the real-world impact of a vulnerability.
    - Security flaws in foundational libraries can have wide-reaching consequences.
