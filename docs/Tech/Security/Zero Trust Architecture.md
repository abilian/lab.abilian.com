**Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)** is a cybersecurity framework that assumes that no user, device, or system, whether inside or outside an organization's network, can be trusted by default. Instead of relying on traditional security models that focus on perimeter defenses (trusting internal network users/devices and distrusting external ones), Zero Trust implements strict identity verification for everyone and everything attempting to access resources, regardless of their location.

While the _Zero Trust_ model is in line with the ‘ _defence in depth_ ’ approach historically promoted by ANSSI, it represents a paradigm shift away from the strict perimeter-based approach that has long prevailed. As a result, if the model is to be implemented, it will have to be progressive: it will require the use of new security solutions which must be integrated into an overall defence system without replacing it. The use of such solutions is difficult: deployment is likely to lead to installation or configuration errors, increase the vulnerability of information systems and give companies a false sense of security.

### Key Principles of Zero Trust Architecture:

1. **Trust No One, Verify Everything**: Every user, device, or application must be authenticated and authorized before being granted access to any resource. Trust is not assumed, even if the entity is already inside the network perimeter.

2. **Least Privilege Access**: Access is limited to only what is necessary for users, devices, or applications to perform their functions. This minimizes the potential damage that can occur if a user or system is compromised.

3. **Continuous Monitoring and Validation**: Zero Trust requires continuous verification of identity, device integrity, and security posture. It doesn’t rely on one-time authentication but constantly monitors user behavior and environmental changes to reassess risks.

4. **Segmentation and Micro-segmentation**: Networks are divided into smaller, isolated zones, and access between these segments is tightly controlled and monitored. Even within the network, systems or services don’t automatically trust one another.

5. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: MFA is a critical component, requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification before granting access. This adds an additional layer of security compared to just passwords.

6. **Strong Encryption**: Communications between systems and devices are encrypted to protect data both in transit and at rest, making it more difficult for attackers to intercept or manipulate data.

7. **Device Security**: Zero Trust also involves ensuring the security of devices that access the network, typically by enforcing compliance with security standards before allowing connection.

### Why Zero Trust?

- **Shifts in Network Topology**: With the increase in remote work, cloud computing, and mobile devices, traditional perimeter-based security models are no longer effective. Data, users, and devices are often distributed across various locations and clouds, making the internal-external boundary of a network blurry.
  
- **Minimizing Attack Surfaces**: A Zero Trust approach minimizes the attack surface by reducing the number of possible entry points for attackers. Even if a system or user is compromised, strict segmentation and limited privileges reduce potential damage.

- **Addressing Insider Threats**: Since Zero Trust does not automatically trust users inside the network, it helps mitigate risks associated with insider threats, which are often overlooked in traditional security models.

### Implementation Components:

1. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Systems for managing user identities, roles, and authentication processes, including MFA and single sign-on (SSO).
   
2. **Network Segmentation**: Using firewalls, software-defined networking (SDN), and virtual private networks (VPNs) to segment network traffic and enforce policies.

3. **Endpoint Security**: Solutions to ensure that devices accessing the network are compliant with security policies, such as mobile device management (MDM) and endpoint detection and response (EDR).

4. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Continuous monitoring of network traffic, user behavior, and security events to detect and respond to threats in real time.

5. **Data Access Control**: Implementing encryption and access controls around sensitive data to ensure that only authorized users and applications can access or modify it.
