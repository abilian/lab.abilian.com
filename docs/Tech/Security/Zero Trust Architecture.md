**Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)** is a cybersecurity framework that assumes that no user, device, or system, whether inside or outside an organization's network, can be trusted by default. Instead of relying on traditional security models that focus on perimeter defenses (trusting internal network users/devices and distrusting external ones), Zero Trust implements strict identity verification for everyone and everything attempting to access resources, regardless of their location.

While the _Zero Trust_ model is in line with the ‘ _defence in depth_ ’ approach historically promoted by ANSSI, it represents a paradigm shift away from the strict perimeter-based approach that has long prevailed. As a result, if the model is to be implemented, it will have to be progressive: it will require the use of new security solutions which must be integrated into an overall defence system without replacing it. The use of such solutions is difficult: deployment is likely to lead to installation or configuration errors, increase the vulnerability of information systems and give companies a false sense of security.

### Key Principles of Zero Trust Architecture:

1. **Trust No One, Verify Everything**: Every user, device, or application must be authenticated and authorized before being granted access to any resource. Trust is not assumed, even if the entity is already inside the network perimeter.

2. **Least Privilege Access**: Access is limited to only what is necessary for users, devices, or applications to perform their functions. This minimizes the potential damage that can occur if a user or system is compromised.

3. **Continuous Monitoring and Validation**: Zero Trust requires continuous verification of identity, device integrity, and security posture. It doesn’t rely on one-time authentication but constantly monitors user behavior and environmental changes to reassess risks.

4. **Segmentation and Micro-segmentation**: Networks are divided into smaller, isolated zones, and access between these segments is tightly controlled and monitored. Even within the network, systems or services don’t automatically trust one another.

5. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: MFA is a critical component, requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification before granting access. This adds an additional layer of security compared to just passwords.

6. **Strong Encryption**: Communications between systems and devices are encrypted to protect data both in transit and at rest, making it more difficult for attackers to intercept or manipulate data.

7. **Device Security**: Zero Trust also involves ensuring the security of devices that access the network, typically by enforcing compliance with security standards before allowing connection.

### Why Zero Trust?

- **Shifts in Network Topology**: With the increase in remote work, cloud computing, and mobile devices, traditional perimeter-based security models are no longer effective. Data, users, and devices are often distributed across various locations and clouds, making the internal-external boundary of a network blurry.

- **Minimizing Attack Surfaces**: A Zero Trust approach minimizes the attack surface by reducing the number of possible entry points for attackers. Even if a system or user is compromised, strict segmentation and limited privileges reduce potential damage.

- **Addressing Insider Threats**: Since Zero Trust does not automatically trust users inside the network, it helps mitigate risks associated with insider threats, which are often overlooked in traditional security models.

### Implementation Components:

1. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Systems for managing user identities, roles, and authentication processes, including MFA and single sign-on (SSO).
2. **Network Segmentation**: Using firewalls, software-defined networking (SDN), and virtual private networks (VPNs) to segment network traffic and enforce policies.
3. **Endpoint Security**: Solutions to ensure that devices accessing the network are compliant with security policies, such as mobile device management (MDM) and endpoint detection and response (EDR).
4. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Continuous monitoring of network traffic, user behavior, and security events to detect and respond to threats in real time.
1. **Data Access Control**: Implementing encryption and access controls around sensitive data to ensure that only authorized users and applications can access or modify it.

## Additional ideas

The described security model adopts a holistic and pragmatic approach to cybersecurity, prioritizing resilience, transparency, and adaptability over rigid compliance frameworks. The model emphasizes four primary security goals and provides both technical and social solutions to address modern cybersecurity challenges.

### Key Principles and Goals

1. **Trust Nothing:**
   - Assumes inherent vulnerabilities in staff, hardware, software, and networks due to systemic backdoors, supply-chain attacks, and external threats.
   - Adopts a zero-trust approach, where every component (laptop, server, smartphone, etc.) is treated as an autonomous system facing the internet.

2. **Goals:**
   - **Keep data:** Ensure data retention and recovery.
   - **Maintain access:** Prevent service outages and downtime.
   - **Reduce leaks:** Minimize the probability and impact of data breaches.
   - **Keep face:** Avoid reputational damage through proactive measures.

3. **Risk-Based Approach:**
   - Cybersecurity measures are proportional to the risks involved, balancing effort and potential impact.
   - Focus on addressing root causes of vulnerabilities rather than temporary fixes.

### Technical Solutions

1. **Data Protection:**
   - Multi-redundant data storage across independent data centers with diverse providers and jurisdictions.
   - Automated disaster recovery and daily backup testing through custom tooling (e.g., SlapOS, NixOS, Hop3...).
   - Measures to protect against bulk deletion, including retention delays and historical database rollbacks.

2. **Access Continuity:**
   - Implementation of a dynamic, "living mesh" network using rotating VPN tunnels for resilience.
   - Integration of advanced routing protocols (e.g., Babel) to ensure minimal latency and traffic redirection during downtime or attacks.
   - Restriction of network access to verified nodes using X.509 certificates.

3. **Leak Mitigation:**
   - Elimination of software, hardware, and cloud services known to have backdoors or legal vulnerabilities under foreign laws (e.g., FISA, CSL).
   - Comprehensive encryption of data in transit and at rest.
   - Use of reverse proxies to shield backend systems from direct internet exposure.
   - Distributed data storage across diverse geographies to mitigate risks from local seizures or breaches.

4. **Proactive Measures:**
   - Automated vulnerability management, including CVE processing and updates.
   - Anti-tampering mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to system files and configurations.

5. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Wider adoption of hardware-based security keys (e.g., Nitrokey).
   - Transition to global crowd-based intrusion detection tools like CrowdSec.
   - Elimination of SSH root access.

### Social and Process-Oriented Solutions

1. **Staff Education and Responsibility:**
   - Continuous cybersecurity training for staff to foster awareness and accountability.
   - Emphasis on a culture of "trust nothing" to reduce susceptibility to social engineering attacks like phishing.

2. **Patch Management:**
   - A structured vulnerability patch process ensures timely identification and resolution of security flaws, with internal coordination before public disclosure.

3. **Customer Collaboration:**
   - Encouragement of independent penetration testing by clients.
   - Implementation of transparent risk analysis processes tailored to customer needs.

### Strengths of the Model

1. **Pragmatic Realism:**
   - Acknowledges the inevitability of vulnerabilities and focuses on mitigating impact rather than achieving unattainable perfection.

2. **Transparency and Decentralization:**
   - Emphasizes open-source software and distributed architectures to reduce dependency on single points of failure.

3. **Resilience-First Design:**
   - Combines technical redundancy with adaptive social strategies to ensure continuity and robustness.

4. **Customizability:**
   - Adaptable policies and processes allow flexibility across varying operational and regulatory contexts.

### Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Challenges:**
   - Limited reliance on established compliance frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001) may reduce external validation.
   - Heavy dependence on internal expertise for auditing open-source components.

2. **Opportunities:**
   - Establishing a transparency-first framework could position this model as a leading alternative to overly bureaucratic, trust-based approaches.
   - Innovations in distributed resilience (e.g., "splinternet" solutions) could serve as benchmarks for global cybersecurity practices.


This security model offers a forward-thinking yet pragmatic approach, integrating technical rigor with social responsibility to address modern cybersecurity risks effectively. By focusing on resilience, transparency, and adaptability, it presents a strong alternative to conventional models reliant on centralized trust mechanisms.
