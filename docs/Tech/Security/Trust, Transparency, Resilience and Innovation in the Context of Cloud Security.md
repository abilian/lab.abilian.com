### Introduction

The increasing digitization of society and the economy necessitates robust frameworks for trust, transparency, and security. However, many current approaches overly emphasize "trust" as a static, centralized construct, often at the expense of transparency, resilience, and sovereignty. This imbalance creates systemic vulnerabilities, fosters dependencies on external providers, and stifles innovation, particularly within Europe.

This document aims to address these challenges by proposing a roadmap for the development of digital ecosystems grounded in **transparency, resilience, and sovereignty**. It highlights critical areas where existing frameworks fall short and offers actionable recommendations to foster a balanced and sustainable digital environment. These recommendations leverage principles such as **Zero Trust security**, **open-source inclusion**, and **decentralized architectures** to promote innovation, enhance system reliability, and ensure compliance with sovereignty requirements.

Each section examines a specific challenge and its implications, presenting solutions that emphasize fairness, security, and long-term competitiveness. By integrating transparency as a cornerstone principle, this roadmap seeks to redefine trust as a dynamic process—one that is continuously verified, monitored, and aligned with European values of independence and collaboration.

This initiative serves as a call to action for policymakers, stakeholders, and innovators to rethink existing paradigms and embrace approaches that prioritize transparency, distributed resilience, and market diversity.

## 1. Transparency vs. Trust

### Challenge: Over-reliance on "trust" without sufficient transparency

The current roadmap heavily emphasizes "trust" while neglecting **transparency**, which is critical for ensuring accountability and reducing reliance on centralized, opaque systems. This lack of transparency risks fostering dependencies on external providers, including non-European cloud solutions, and undermines stakeholder autonomy.

### Contribution to the Roadmap:

- Introduce **transparency as a foundational principle** alongside trust to enable stakeholders to independently verify security, resilience, and control mechanisms.
- Leverage **Zero Trust principles** to redefine trust-forwarding as continuous verification and monitoring, ensuring compliance and security without reliance on blind trust.

### Proposed Action:

- Develop **shared transparency frameworks** to allow stakeholders to verify compliance and security claims independently.
- Design and implement a **risk assessment grid** to enable granular evaluations of providers and solutions based on specific stakeholder needs.
- Incorporate **Zero Trust methodologies** into the roadmap to enhance continuous validation and secure data access.

## 2. Support for Open Source and European Innovation

### Challenge: Discrimination against European open-source and SME-driven solutions

Current policies and standards favor large centralized providers over open-source alternatives and SME-driven solutions, stifling innovation and undermining resilience in Europe.

### Contribution to the Roadmap:

- Prioritize **open-source inclusion** as a key pillar of trust due to its inherent transparency and collaborative development model.
- Support distributed, resilient models that leverage Europe’s technological strengths.
- Encourage **federated architectures** to prevent systemic vulnerabilities and enable diverse market participation.

### Proposed Action:

- Include open-source solutions in procurement policies, emphasizing their **transparency** and **collaborative approach**.
- Create **incentives for SMEs and open-source initiatives** by reducing bureaucratic hurdles, such as excessive auditing requirements.
- Establish funding and policy support for **federated, multi-provider systems** to enhance resilience and innovation.


## 3. Resilience through Decentralization

### Challenge: Centralized systems increase systemic vulnerabilities

Centralized architectures create single points of failure, making them more vulnerable to cyber threats and outages. Distributed models are inherently more resilient, as they spread risk across multiple independent providers.

### Contribution to the Roadmap:

- Promote **resilience** as a critical trust principle by advocating for decentralized architectures in data spaces and cloud ecosystems.
- Encourage the adoption of distributed models to mitigate systemic vulnerabilities and enhance system reliability.

### Proposed Action:

- Establish standards and incentives for **multi-provider architectures** that prevent **single points of failure**.
- Fund research and development for **distributed and federated systems** to replace monolithic architectures.

## 4. Aligning Security with Sovereignty

### Challenge: Dependency on foreign technologies undermines sovereignty

Reliance on non-European cloud solutions exposes European systems to extraterritorial laws, such as the U.S. **CLOUD Act** (+ **FISA**, etc.) which undermines data sovereignty and compromises security.

### Contribution to the Roadmap:

- Reassess the role of sovereignty within trust frameworks, emphasizing solutions that are **immune to extraterritorial laws**.
- Position **digital sovereignty** as a non-negotiable principle for all data-sharing frameworks.

### Proposed Action:

- Implement **audit mechanisms for supply chains** to ensure that hardware and software meet sovereignty requirements.
- Mandate **Zero Trust compliance** for systems handling sensitive data, integrating continuous validation and secure access protocols.
- Support **European-led initiatives** that prioritize sovereign and secure cloud solutions.

## 5. Challenges with Current Certification Models

### Challenge: Heavy-handed certification schemes disadvantage European providers

Existing certification processes favor large vendors with centralized solutions, creating barriers for innovative SMEs and open-source projects.

### Contribution to the Roadmap:

- Redesign certification schemes to focus on **functional resilience, transparency, and collaborative security measures** rather than rigid bureaucratic requirements.
- **Simplify** processes to make certifications accessible to smaller providers and open-source initiatives.

### Proposed Action:

- Introduce **modular certifications** to evaluate specific components rather than entire systems, enabling smaller providers to compete effectively.
- Develop **adaptive certification models** based on real-time validation metrics derived from Zero Trust principles.
- Reduce **bureaucratic** overhead for **SMEs and open-source projects** to encourage fair competition.

## 6. Cybersecurity and New Technological Approaches

### Challenge: Obsolete programming paradigms and reactive cybersecurity measures

Legacy programming languages and perimeter-based security models fail to address modern cybersecurity threats, leaving systems vulnerable to sophisticated attacks.

### Contribution to the Roadmap:

- Promote **modern, security-by-design principles** to enhance the resilience of software and systems.
- Transition to **new-generation programming languages** and frameworks that inherently reduce vulnerabilities.

### Proposed Action:

- Fund research into **cybersecurity-focused programming languages** and architectures aligned with Zero Trust principles.
