Prefect is a modern workflow management system designed to help you build, schedule, and monitor data workflows. It is often compared to [[Apache Airflow]], as both systems are built on [[00 Python]] and have similar goals in terms of orchestrating complex data pipelines. However, Prefect offers some unique features and improvements over Airflow that make it an attractive alternative.

## Key features

1. **Hybrid execution model**: Prefect combines the benefits of a centralized server for monitoring and management with decentralized execution. This means that your tasks run on separate infrastructure, which can help with scaling, security, and resource management.
2. **Dynamic pipelines**: Prefect allows you to create dynamic pipelines that can change during runtime, making it easier to handle complex dependencies, conditional logic, and error handling.
3. **First-class support for failures:** Prefect has built-in support for retries, timeouts, and error handling, which makes it easier to build resilient workflows.
5. **Modern UI**: Prefect comes with a modern, intuitive web-based UI for monitoring and managing your workflows, as well as a GraphQL API for programmatic access.

## Installation

To install Prefect, use the following command:
```
pip install prefect
```

Note that at the time of writing, `pipx install prefect` won't work.

## Example usage

Here's a simple example of using Prefect to create a workflow with two tasks:

```python
# file: demo.py
from prefect import task, flow


@task
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, world!")


@task
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")


@flow
def main():
    hello = say_hello()
    greet_hello = greet("Prefect")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(main())
```

Then, register the deployment:

```shell
python demo.py
```

To schedule and monitor your Prefect workflows, you can use Prefect's server and agent components. First, start the Prefect server with Docker by running:

```shell
prefect server start
```

Then, start a Prefect agent to execute your flows:

```
prefect agent local start
```

You should now be able to see and manage your flow through the Prefect web UI at `http://localhost:8080`.

In summary, Prefect is a modern, flexible, and powerful alternative to Apache Airflow for building, scheduling, and monitoring data workflows. With its hybrid execution model, dynamic pipelines, first-class support for failures, and flexible deployment options, it offers several advantages that make it an attractive choice for managing complex data pipelines.
