## In python

At [[00 Abilian]], we strongly prefer using `Pytest` and `tox` for our tests.

### Web tests

- https://github.com/cobrateam/splinter = python test framework for web applications. Similar to Selenium.
- https://github.com/mozilla/PyPOM = Page Object Model implementation (dead project, but still useful)

### BDD

- https://github.com/behave/behave = modern BDD / Gherkin implem for Python
- https://github.com/ggozad/behaving = combines Behave and Splinter
