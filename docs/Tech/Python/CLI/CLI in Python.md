## CLI frameworks

### From the standard library

1.  **argparse**: argparse is a built-in Python module that provides a way to parse command-line arguments. It's easy to use and provides a lot of flexibility, making it a popular choice for writing command-line interfaces in Python. 
    - â†’ More info + tutorial: [[Argparse]]

### Frameworks based on argparse

See [[Argparse#Usage in higher-level CLI frameworks]]

### Click family

1.  **Click**: a popular Python CLI framework that is built on top of `optparse`. It provides a more user-friendly interface than `argparse` and adds several useful features, such as command grouping, automatic help page generation, and more.
2.  **Typer**: a relatively new Python CLI framework that is also built on top of Click. It provides a simpler interface than Click and aims to be very easy to use. Typer is particularly well-suited for creating CLI tools that interact with APIs.

Click is internally based on `optparse` instead of `argparse`. This is an implementation detail that a user does not have to be concerned with. Click is not based on `argparse` because it has some behaviors that make handling arbitrary command line interfaces hard:
-   `argparse` has built-in behavior to guess if something is an argument or an option. This becomes a problem when dealing with incomplete command lines; the behaviour becomes unpredictable without full knowledge of a command line. This goes against Click's ambitions of dispatching to subparsers.
-   `argparse` does not support disabling interspersed arguments. Without this feature, it's not possible to safely implement Click's nested parsing.

### Others

1. **docopt**: docopt is another Python package that provides a way to define a CLI by describing it in a docstring. It automatically generates the parser and makes it easy to define complex command-line interfaces.
