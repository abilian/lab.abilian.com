## Misc ideas for a new API

Goals:

- Ease / naturalness of use
- Type safety

Shell object: `shell = Shell()`

Run something: `result = shell.ls()`

With options: `result = shell.ls(l=True)` (== `ls -l`).

Errors recovery:

```
try:
	result = shell.ls()
except ShellException as e:
	print(e.status)
```

Strong typing: generate `.pyi` files for common commands ? By parsing man pages ?

Piping: `shell.ls().pipe.grep('*.py')` ? bof.

`shell.pipe(shell.ls(), shell.grep('*.py')` ? (Needs to parse AST inside the pip argument).
