Python is the main programming language used by the Abilian development team.

We're using Python for:

- Web projects
- Cloud projects, such as [Nua](https://nua.rocks/)
- Data management projects
- Data analytics projects
- AI projects

The choice of Python as our main programming language is due to its versatility, readability, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, which make it well-suited for developing web applications, data processing pipelines, and more.
