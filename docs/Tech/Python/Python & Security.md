"[Pyre](https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check) from Facebook is an amazing project that has a bright future and many smart people working on it. I would suggest, if you don't know that much about program analysis, that you understand how PyT works before diving into Pyre. Along with the [README's in most directories](https://github.com/python-security/pyt/tree/master/pyt#how-it-works), there are the original [Master's Thesis](https://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/files/239563289/final.pdf) and [some slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JfAykAxR0DcJwwGfHmhrz1RhhKqYsnt5x_GY8CbTp7s)."

https://pyre-check.org/docs/pysa-basics/ "Pyre has applications beyond type checking python code: it can also run static analysis, more specifically called **Taint Analysis**, to identify potential security issues. The Python Static Analyzer feature of Pyre is usually abbreviated to Pysa (pronounced like the Leaning Tower of Pisa)."
