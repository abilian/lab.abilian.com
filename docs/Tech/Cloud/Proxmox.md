   - **Kernel Modules**: Various kernel modules are used to provide hardware virtualization, networking, and storage capabilities.

### KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)
   - **Type-1 Hypervisor**: Proxmox uses **KVM** as its hypervisor for full virtualization. KVM is a part of the Linux kernel and allows the host machine to run multiple isolated virtual machines, each with its own operating system. KVM is known for its performance and stability, making it one of the most widely used virtualization technologies in enterprise environments.
   - **QEMU**: Along with KVM, Proxmox relies on **QEMU** (Quick Emulator) to emulate the hardware for virtual machines. QEMU works in conjunction with KVM to provide efficient virtualized hardware for VMs, enabling the use of multiple OSes on the same physical machine.

### LXC (Linux Containers)
   - **Lightweight Virtualization**: Proxmox integrates **LXC** for container-based virtualization. LXC allows for running multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) on the same host using a shared kernel. Containers are much more lightweight than VMs and are ideal for running isolated applications with lower resource overhead.
   - **Linux namespaces and cgroups**: LXC uses the kernel’s **namespaces** for process isolation and **control groups (cgroups)** for resource management, allowing containers to share resources while remaining isolated.
