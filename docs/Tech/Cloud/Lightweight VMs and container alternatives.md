> Firecracker, the microVM hypervisor, is renowned for being lightweight, fast, and secure. It's excellent for running short-lived workloads, which is why it's the backbone of AWS Lambda. After weeks of testing, we decided to entirely replace it with QEMU. A little-known fact about Firecracker is its lack of support for many modern hypervisor features, such as dynamic RAM management, which is vital for long-lived workloads. In this post, I will explain why Firecracker might not be the best hypervisor choice and when you should avoid it.

## Jail

- https://github.com/fsquillace/junest = The lightweight Arch Linux based distro that runs, without root privileges, upon any Linux distro
- https://nsjail.dev/ "NsJail is a lightweight process isolation tool leveraging Linux namespaces and seccomp-bpf to enhance security and resource management across our infrastructure."
