**Buildout** is a Python-based automation tool for assembling and managing software environments. It simplifies processes such as software building, configuration file generation, and deployment automation. Buildout supports all stages of a software lifecycle, from development to production deployment.

For differences between SlapOS's buildout and upstream buildout, see [[Differences Between Upstream Buildout and SlapOS's Variant]].

## Key Features

1. **Repeatability**:

    - Two instances of Buildout using the same configuration in identical environments (e.g., operating system, Python version) will yield identical builds.
    - This ensures consistency and reduces issues stemming from environmental variations.

1. **Componentization**:

    - Encourages software projects to include tools for tasks such as monitoring and deployment, making the software self-sufficient.
    - Buildout-generated configurations simplify development, deployment, and operational monitoring.

1. **Automation**:

    - Automates the environment setup using a configuration file (`buildout.cfg`).
    - A single command can recreate the entire software environment, saving time and reducing error-prone manual configurations.

## Getting Started with Buildout

### Installation

Buildout is typically installed within a virtual environment:

```bash
virtualenv mybuildout
cd mybuildout
bin/pip install zc.buildout
```

### Minimal Configuration

A basic `buildout.cfg` configuration file:

```ini
[buildout]
parts =
```

Running `buildout` with this configuration creates the following directories:

- **bin**: Holds executables.
- **develop-eggs**: Contains links to development packages.
- **eggs**: Stores installed Python packages.
- **parts**: A default location for installed components.

### Adding a Part

Parts represent tasks or components in Buildout. For example, to install a web server:

```ini
[buildout]
parts = bobo

[bobo]
recipe = zc.recipe.egg
eggs = bobo
```

Running `buildout` will:

- Install the specified recipe (`zc.recipe.egg`).
- Download and install the `bobo` package and its dependencies.
- Place any scripts provided by `bobo` into the `bin` directory.


## Advanced Buildout Features

### Generating Custom Scripts and Configurations:

Buildout recipes can generate scripts and configuration files, enabling deeper automation. For example, configuring a daemonized web server:

```ini
[buildout]
parts = bobo server

[bobo]
recipe = zc.recipe.egg
eggs = bobo

[server]
recipe = zc.zdaemonrecipe
program =
  ${buildout:bin-directory}/bobo
  --port 8200
```

Here, Buildout:

- Sets up a server using `zc.zdaemonrecipe`.
- Generates configuration files and scripts for starting/stopping the server.

### Version Control:

Only the `buildout.cfg` file needs to be versioned. Buildout regenerates all required files, ensuring consistency across environments.


## Buildout for Python Development

Buildout simplifies Python project management with the `develop` option:

```ini
[buildout]
develop = .
parts = py

[py]
recipe = zc.recipe.egg
eggs = main
interpreter = py
```

This configuration:

- Creates an interpreter (`bin/py`) with dependencies specified in the `eggs` option.
- Allows testing and running Python scripts within the configured environment.


## Managing Dependencies with Buildout

### Pinning Versions:

To ensure repeatability, dependencies can be pinned:

```ini
[versions]
bobo = 2.3.0
```

### Updating Versions:

Buildout can maintain a versions file:

```ini
[buildout]
update-versions-file = versions.cfg
```

This feature tracks and records version changes automatically, enabling controlled upgrades.



## Additional Notes

- **Recipes**: Pre-defined Buildout extensions handle specific tasks, such as installing packages, generating scripts, or configuring systems.
- **Custom Recipes**: Writing a custom recipe is straightforward for tasks not covered by existing ones.
- **Virtual Environments**: Buildout integrates seamlessly with virtual environments to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts.

For further details and recipes, consult the [official Buildout documentation](https://buildout.readthedocs.io/).


## When to Use Buildout

Buildout is suitable for projects requiring:

- Complex configurations involving multiple components or tools.
- Reproducibility across development and production environments.
- Custom scripts or non-Python components integrated into the software.


## Alternatives

### Python-Specific Tools

#### Pip and Virtualenv (or `venv`)

**Description**: Pip is the default Python package manager, and `virtualenv` or `venv` provides environment isolation.

- **Strengths**:

    - Lightweight and simple.
    - Widely used, with a large ecosystem.
    - Works seamlessly with `requirements.txt` for dependency pinning.

- **Limitations**:

    - No built-in support for non-Python dependencies.
    - Limited automation capabilities compared to Buildout.
    - Dependency management can become cumbersome for large projects.

- **Best Use Cases**:

    - Simple Python-only projects.
    - Projects where minimal tooling is preferred.
