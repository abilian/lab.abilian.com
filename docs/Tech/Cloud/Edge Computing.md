Edge Computing extends the capabilities of cloud computing by bringing computation closer to the source of data. While cloud computing primarily involves a few large data centers (DC) with thousands of servers, edge computing distributes computing resources across thousands of smaller data centers closer to the devices generating data. Both edge and cloud computing offer automation, but they differ in scale and location.

## Types of Edge Computing:

1. **Edge Data Centre (DC):** These involve 16 to 32 servers in a rack and are located within 100 km from the user. This model closely mirrors the hardware used by major cloud service providers.

2. **Campus Edge:** Consists of small servers situated within an office, factory, or campus. These are low-power, small-sized, and designed to be less than 1 km from the user.

3. **Edge IoT:** These are embedded systems directly integrated into IoT devices, drones, machine tools, or 5G base stations, running within 1 meter of the user.

Each type has its latency constraints:

- DC Edge is suitable for up to 1 millisecond latency use-cases like C-RAN.
- Campus Edge is geared for up to ten microseconds latency use-cases like industrial automation.
- Edge IoT can handle extremely low latency use-cases, up to 10 nanoseconds, like radio units or autopilots.

### Advantages of Edge Computing

#### Resiliency:

- **Splinternet and Geopolitics:** Edge computing allows for continued operations even when broader internet access is restricted due to regulatory or geopolitical issues.
- **Energy Availability:** Edge computing gives organizations the flexibility to choose locations based on energy costs and availability.

#### Latency:

Edge computing can drastically reduce the time it takes for data to travel between the client and the server, which is vital in applications like industrial automation and 5G services.

#### Global Availability:

In places where major cloud providers are not available, edge computing can offer local solutions.

#### Legal Immunity and Compliance:

The locality of edge computing can allow organizations to choose jurisdictions that align with their legal and compliance requirements.

#### Economic Efficiency:

While cloud computing offers economies of scale, it also faces diminishing returns beyond a certain size. Edge computing can be scaled down to avoid these inefficiencies.

## Summary

Both edge and cloud computing provide the automation and scalability that modern IT services require, but they serve different needs and scenarios. 

Edge computing offers specific advantages in terms of resiliency, latency, global availability, legal compliance, and economic efficiency, making it an essential component of modern IT architectures.
