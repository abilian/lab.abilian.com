## minikanren by Brandon Willard

"In the following sections we detail our implementation of miniKanren (Willard 2020d), operating under the PyPi name miniKanren and Python package name kanren. We also describe its ecosystem of complementary packages etuples, cons, and symbolic-pymc. kanren is a fork that tries to maintain syntactic parity with its predecessor logpy (Rocklin 2018), but now deviates significantly in terms of core mechanics and offerings."
