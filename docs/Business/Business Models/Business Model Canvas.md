The Business Model Canvas, created by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur, is a strategic management and entrepreneurial tool that allows you to describe, design, challenge, invent, and pivot your business model. It's a visual chart with elements describing a firm's or product's value proposition, infrastructure, customers, and finances. 

The nine building blocks of the Business Model Canvas are:

1.  **Customer Segments**: These are the groups of people or organizations an enterprise aims to reach and serve.
    
2.  **Value Propositions**: These are the bundle of products and services that create value for a specific Customer Segment.
    
3.  **Channels**: These are the company's touchpoints with its customers. They are how a company communicates with and reaches its Customer Segments to deliver a Value Proposition.
    
4.  **Customer Relationships**: These are the types of relationships a company establishes with specific Customer Segments.
    
5.  **Revenue Streams**: This is the cash a company generates from each Customer Segment (costs must be subtracted from revenues to create earnings).
    
6.  **Key Resources**: These are the most important assets required to make a business model work.
    
7.  **Key Activities**: These are the most important activities a company must execute to make its business model work.
    
8.  **Key Partnerships**: These are the network of suppliers and partners that make the business model work.
    
9.  **Cost Structure**: These are all the costs incurred to operate a business model.

Using the Business Model Canvas, organizations can easily brainstorm and visualize their business model, and then further iterate and evolve their ideas.
