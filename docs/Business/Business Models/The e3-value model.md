The e3-value model, developed by Gordijn and Akkermans in 2003, is a methodology used for designing and evaluating business models for e-business. It provides a graphical representation of the exchange of value between a network of business actors. The primary focus of the e3-value model is on the value that is created, distributed, and consumed within this network.

Here are some key concepts of the e3-value model:

1.  **Value Object**: This represents goods, services, or money that are of economic value to at least one of the actors.
    
2.  **Actor**: An actor is an economically independent entity that perceives value from its involvement in the business model.
    
3.  **Value Port**: A value port is used by an actor to provide or request value objects to or from other actors.
    
4.  **Value Transfer**: This represents the exchange of value objects between two actors.
    
5.  **Value Interface**: This encapsulates the value ports of an actor and shows how an actor wants to interact (in terms of value exchange) with its environment.
    
6.  **Value Exchange**: This represents the potential exchange of value objects between actors.
    
7.  **Value Activity**: Value activities are the operations performed by an actor to yield value for other actors.
    
8.  **Market Segment**: A market segment is a group of actors who assign economic value to things similarly.
    
9.  **Stakeholder**: Stakeholders have an interest in the business model but do not necessarily participate in value exchanges.

One of the strengths of the e3-value model is its emphasis on the analysis of the economic sustainability of a business model. By analyzing the exchange of value between different actors, it allows for the identification of potential imbalances that could compromise the long-term viability of the business model.

## Legacy

The e3-value model has made significant contributions to the understanding and development of business models, particularly in the context of e-business. This includes:

1. **Business Model Visualization**: The e3-value model provides a clear, graphical representation of the flows of value within a business network. This has been influential in the development of other business model canvases and visual tools.

2. **Value-Centric Approach**: The e3-value model places a strong emphasis on the creation, delivery, and capture of value. This focus on value has since become a central theme in many contemporary business model frameworks and discussions.

3. **Network Perspective**: The e3-value model highlights the importance of considering the broader network of actors involved in a business model, not just the focal company. This has informed subsequent research and practice in areas such as ecosystem strategies and platform business models.

4. **Economic Sustainability Analysis**: The model's emphasis on assessing the balance of value exchanges for economic sustainability has contributed to a greater appreciation of this aspect in business model analysis.

5. **E-Business Research**: The e3-value model was one of the early models addressing e-business specifically. It provided a structured way to consider the unique dynamics and opportunities of e-business models, and this has shaped research in this area.

Overall, while the e3-value model may not be as widely known or used as some other business model frameworks (like the [[Business Model Canvas]] by Osterwalder and Pigneur), its ideas have permeated into many aspects of business model theory and practice.
