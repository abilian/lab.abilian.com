A **Public Benefit Company (PBC)** is a specific type of corporation that is legally committed to balancing profit-making with broader societal or environmental objectives. It is typically established under laws that allow businesses to pursue objectives beyond maximizing shareholder profits, which is the traditional mandate of a corporation.

### Key Characteristics of Public Benefit Companies:

1. **Dual Purpose**:
   PBCs are structured to serve both their financial bottom line and a public benefit purpose, such as environmental sustainability, social equity, or public health. This dual mission is often codified in their corporate charter.

2. **Accountability and Transparency**:
   - They are required to regularly report on their progress toward achieving their public benefit purpose.
   - Stakeholders, beyond shareholders, often have some legal standing to hold the company accountable.

3. **Governance**:
   Boards of directors in PBCs must balance the interests of shareholders with those of the broader public and the specific mission outlined in the company's charter.

4. **Legal Framework**:
   PBCs are recognized in jurisdictions like the United States (especially under **Delaware law**, which is influential in corporate governance). They are sometimes referred to as **B Corporations**, though "B Corp" is technically a certification offered by a nonprofit (B Lab), while "Public Benefit Company" refers to the legal structure.

### Equivalent in France: The **Entreprise à Mission**

France does not have an exact equivalent to the U.S. Public Benefit Company but has a similar framework in the **Entreprise à Mission** introduced by the *Pacte Law* (Loi Pacte) in 2019.

#### Key Features of the *Entreprise à Mission*:
1. **Purpose Statement**:
   - The company must define its "raison d'être" (reason for being), which is its core purpose beyond profit.
   - This statement is included in the company's bylaws (*statuts*).

2. **Specific Objectives**:
   - The company must identify social or environmental objectives that it will pursue in alignment with its purpose.

3. **Monitoring and Accountability**:
   - A monitoring committee (*comité de mission*) oversees the company's progress toward its objectives and ensures accountability. This committee typically includes external experts and representatives of various stakeholders.
   - The company must also appoint an independent third-party auditor (*organisme tiers indépendant*) to verify its claims and performance regarding its mission.

4. **Legal Recognition**:
   - An *Entreprise à Mission* retains its legal structure as a Société Anonyme (SA), Société par Actions Simplifiée (SAS), or another form of company under French law. However, the mission designation introduces a new layer of accountability.

### Comparison: Public Benefit Company vs. *Entreprise à Mission*
| **Aspect**               | **Public Benefit Company (PBC)**             | **Entreprise à Mission**                  |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Jurisdiction**          | Predominantly U.S.                         | France                                   |
| **Legal Basis**           | Specific statutes, e.g., Delaware law       | Pacte Law (2019)                        |
| **Purpose**               | General public benefit + profit            | Defined *raison d’être* + profit         |
| **Accountability**        | Reports to shareholders and stakeholders    | *Comité de mission* and third-party audits |
| **Mission Codification**  | Integrated into corporate charter           | Included in company bylaws               |

### Broader European Context

Other European countries are introducing similar models:
- **United Kingdom**: The concept of a "Community Interest Company (CIC)" parallels a Public Benefit Company by focusing on delivering social benefits.
- **Germany and the Nordics**: The focus is often on corporate social responsibility (CSR) embedded in traditional company law rather than separate legal designations.

France's *Entreprise à Mission* provides a robust and structured approach to integrating public benefit objectives into the corporate legal framework, making it one of the most analogous models to the U.S. Public Benefit Company.
