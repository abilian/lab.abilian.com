> My guidance to folks is almost always universal: Tell me what we're trying to achieve, paint a picture of the end result. Give me data, a defense, on why we're trying to achieve it. Measure the progress, and set constraints (e.g. time, spend) to achieve results. <https://twitter.com/zeeg/status/1752040672465658179>
