"**Product-led growth** is a business strategy that relies on using your product as the main vehicle to acquire, activate, and retain customers. If you’ve used Slack or Dropbox, you’ve witnessed this first-hand – you didn’t read a lengthy whitepaper on the benefits of strong internal communication or cloud-based file sharing. You wanted to see the product in action!".

### Open Source is Key to Product-Led Growth

The product-led growth model is no secret. It’s as effective as it is popular, particularly in the B2B SaaS market. SaaS players like [Figma](https://foundationinc.co/lab/figma-community-growth/), Slack, [Notion](https://foundationinc.co/lab/notion-strategy), and countless others have used it as a growth catalyst. 

It allows startups and growing companies to focus on the singular pursuit of developing the ultimate digital tool while circumventing [growth-related issues](https://productled.com/blog/product-led-growth-definition/) like: 

-   The ever-increasing cost of paid advertising
-   A preference for self-education among B2B consumers
-   Direct product experience as part of the buying process

All stages of the customer journey—acquisition, expansion, conversion, and retention—are driven by the product itself. Not just sales or marketing. 

There’s company-wide alignment on delivering the best user experience possible. That means sales, marketing, product engineering, product design, and customer success all channel their efforts into creating a product that provides an unparalleled UX. Product development puts all departments on the same wavelength in terms of the end goal.

The perfect analogy for this growth model comes in the form of this image from the experts at the [Product-Led Growth Collective](https://www.productled.org/foundations/what-is-product-led-growth#Chap1):

It’s not about everyone deferring to the product team. It’s about each department making an equal contribution to creating the best possible user experience. 

Here’s a breakdown of the process and how marketing fits into the picture:

**1. Deploy all departments to ensure the product is perfect for the end user’s needs—not wowing the purchaser.**

Marketers: Put on your research cap and do a comprehensive deep dive into your ICP (P.S. It’s about more than just social media scouring).

**2. Offer up this highly effective,** **free** **product to users (not buyers).**

Marketers: Be direct about the immediate value of the product and structure pages to reduce friction.

**3. Users become “activated” by the product, and become key drivers for “viral” growth by spreading the word through social channels.** 

Marketers: Find out where people are talking organically about your product, look for opportunities to build community, and leverage social proof.

**4. Additional features are layered on top of the free model, compelling users to purchase as their needs grow (often with minimal need for sales).**

Marketers: Work with the product and sales team to determine the best positioning for extending and expanding users into paid offerings.

To the end user, the product itself handles everything from onboarding to extension. But all departments are actively involved—their efforts are just rolled directly to the product for the initial growth stage. 

By prioritizing the end user’s experience over everything, product-led flips the old gatekeeper model on its head. Top-down growth strategies rely on authoritative implementation and provide inconsistent growth. Bottom-up approaches rely on social proof and provide sustained growth. 

The IT pros we touched on in the first section are key for this growth strategy, particularly for cloud-native products. If the developer, operations, networking, or security pros like the product, they can convince admins, managers, and executives to investigate paid options.

Companies providing open-source products typically apply one of three methods to get users and their teams/enterprises into the revenue stream: 

1.  **Limit feature access**
2.  **Limit capacity/storage**
3.  **Limit access to support**

This is one area where HashiCorp differs from the conventional. They know that developers and enterprise teams hate having functionality limited. Instead, they opt to limit scale (but more on that later).

This growth model has been proven time and again across different SaaS verticals, but the explosive growth occurring in the cloud space gives this strategy an outsized impact, particularly for companies with the capability to expand across the four key user segments of cloud: developers, operators, security, and networkers.

Case in point: HashiCorp’s multi-product long-term growth engine.
