A manager should be action-oriented because it helps drive progress, achieve goals, and foster a sense of urgency and accomplishment within the team. Being action-oriented means focusing on taking concrete steps to address challenges, execute plans, and deliver results. Here's why and how a manager should be action-oriented:

## Why:

1. Inspire and motivate the team: When a manager demonstrates a strong commitment to taking action and achieving results, it motivates team members to follow suit and work towards their goals.

2. Drive progress: Action-oriented managers help ensure that projects move forward by actively addressing issues, making decisions, and executing plans.

3. Improve efficiency: By focusing on action, a manager can reduce the time spent on unnecessary discussions, meetings, or analysis, and allocate resources more effectively to accomplish tasks.

4. Build trust and credibility: Managers who consistently deliver results and follow through on their commitments gain the trust and respect of their team members, colleagues, and superiors.

5. Foster a results-driven culture: An action-oriented manager sets the tone for the team, creating a culture that prioritizes results, execution, and continuous improvement.

## How:

1. Set clear goals and priorities: Establish SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals for yourself and your team. Clearly communicate these goals and priorities to ensure everyone understands what needs to be accomplished.

2. Develop a plan of action: Create a detailed plan outlining the steps, resources, and timeline required to achieve your goals. Regularly review and update the plan as needed.

3. Make timely decisions: As a manager, you will face situations that require prompt decision-making. Evaluate the available information, consult with your team when necessary, and make decisions quickly to maintain momentum.

4. Delegate tasks effectively: Delegate tasks to team members based on their skills, experience, and workload. Ensure they have the resources and support needed to complete their tasks.

5. Monitor progress and adjust as needed: Regularly track progress against your goals and adjust your plan of action if required. Address any obstacles or challenges that arise promptly and decisively.

6. Encourage action from your team: Foster a sense of urgency by setting deadlines and holding team members accountable for their tasks. Encourage them to take ownership of their work and provide support when needed.

7. Celebrate achievements: Recognize and reward the accomplishments of your team, both individually and collectively. Celebrating success helps maintain motivation and reinforces the importance of being action-oriented.

By being action-oriented, a manager can drive progress, achieve goals, and create a results-driven culture within their team. This approach leads to improved efficiency, trust, and overall performance.
