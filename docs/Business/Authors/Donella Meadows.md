Donella Meadows (1941-2001) was an influential environmental scientist, systems thinker, and author, best known for her work on global sustainability and her involvement in the development of the groundbreaking book "The Limits to Growth" (1972). While her primary focus was on environmental and sustainability issues, her systems thinking approach has been applied to various fields, including business and management.

Meadows was a pioneer in using systems thinking to understand and address complex issues, such as resource depletion, population growth, and environmental degradation. Her work has inspired many business leaders and organizations to consider the long-term consequences of their actions and to adopt more sustainable practices.

One of her most well-known works, "Thinking in Systems: A Primer" (2008), published posthumously, serves as an introduction to systems thinking and has been widely read by people in various fields, including business and management.

While Donella Meadows may not be primarily known as a business thinker, her work on systems thinking and sustainability has had a lasting impact on the way businesses approach complex problems and consider their role in fostering a more sustainable world.
