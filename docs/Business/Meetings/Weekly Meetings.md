## Agenda

1. **Core Values Moment**
2. **Business Review**
3. **Communications**
4. **Progress Updates**
5. **Decisions**


### 1. Core Values Moment

Kick off your meeting by reinforcing the core values that define your team’s culture. Dedicate the first 30-60 seconds to discuss one core value. Avoid corporate jargon; instead, encourage your team to share a brief, relevant experience. For example, if "Customer Focus" is a core value, don’t proceed until someone shares a customer interaction. This practice keeps core values at the forefront of everyone’s mind and demonstrates their real-world relevance.

#### Tips

- **Start with a Story:** Begin the meeting with a compelling story that highlights a recent customer interaction or a safety incident. This not only emphasizes the importance of these values but also sets a positive and reflective tone for the meeting.
- **Engage the Team:** Rather than a monologue, turn this moment into a dialogue. Ask for volunteers to share their experiences, creating a sense of involvement and ownership of the values.
- **Consistency is Key:** Make this a regular feature of every meeting to underline the continuous importance of core values in everyday operations.

### 2. Business Review

Shift the focus to a business review. Ask the question, "How are we tracking for our quarterly objectives?" This review should encompass company, division, and team levels. If any area is falling behind, discuss actionable plans to get back on track. Use this time to reinforce the week’s priorities and explain the relationship between input metrics (e.g., leads contacted) and output metrics (e.g., sales made).

#### Tips

- **Checkpoint in the Journey:** Treat this as a routine checkpoint. Regularly revisiting your goals keeps the team aligned and motivated, ensuring everyone is aware of their progress and what needs attention.
- **Data-Driven Discussions:** Incorporate relevant data and metrics in your review. Visual aids like charts and graphs can make the review more engaging and easier to understand.
- **Action Plans:** Always leave this section with clear action items for areas needing improvement, ensuring there is a roadmap to get back on track.

### 3. Communications

Move into the core of the meeting with key communications. Often these messages originate from senior leadership. Be clear and concrete in your explanations, using examples that are relevant to your team. Instead of the generic “Any questions?”, ask, “Are there any doubts?” or “Is it clear what this means to you?” If you’ve sent an advance copy of the communication, use this time for discussion and clarification rather than repetition.

#### Tips

- **Storytelling Approach:** Imagine you’re a storyteller bringing important news from the front lines. Your goal is to ensure everyone not only hears but understands the implications and feels confident in their roles.
- **Engagement:** Use this time to engage with your team, inviting questions and discussions to ensure clarity and alignment.
- **Follow-Up:** Summarize key points and follow up with written communication if necessary to reinforce the messages discussed.

### 4. Progress Updates

When it’s time for progress updates, foster a dynamic discussion by asking team members about the key obstacles they’re facing. This approach encourages a constructive environment where projects can be advanced and risks mitigated. Remind everyone that the objective is to improve the status of their projects, not merely report on them.

#### Tips

- **Collaborative Workshop:** Think of this segment as a collaborative workshop. Each team member presents their challenges, and together, you brainstorm solutions, ensuring everyone leaves the meeting better equipped to succeed.
- **Focused Questions:** Ask targeted questions such as “What’s the bottleneck?” or “How can we support you?” to elicit useful information and solutions.
- **Active Problem Solving:** Encourage the team to actively participate in problem-solving, rather than passively listening to updates.

### 5. Decisions

Reserve the end of the meeting for decision-making. This allows non-essential participants to leave if the discussion doesn’t pertain to them. Clearly set the expectations and desired outcomes for each decision. After the discussion, evaluate the effectiveness of the decision-making process and consider what could be improved for next time.

#### Tips

- **Culmination of the Journey:** Visualize this part as the culmination of your journey. The decisions made here set the course for the next leg of the trip, ensuring everyone knows the direction and their role in steering the ship.
- **Clear Outcomes:** Define clear outcomes and responsibilities to avoid ambiguity. Everyone should leave knowing what’s been decided and what their role is in implementing it.
- **Post-Decision Reflection:** After the meeting, reflect on the decision-making process. What worked well? What could be improved? Use this reflection to enhance future meetings.

### Additional Recommendations

#### Focus on Meeting Effectiveness

To ensure that your meetings are beneficial for all participants, it is important to periodically gather feedback on how they are run and make necessary adjustments. Pay attention to moments that feel like a waste of time and actively work to eliminate them. Observe the body language of attendees for signs of disengagement and address the underlying causes.

**Tip:** Think of yourself as a conductor, fine-tuning the orchestra. Your goal is to ensure each meeting hits the right notes, keeping the team engaged and the performance harmonious.

#### Coach Communication Skills

Many team members may not have been coached on how to effectively participate in meetings. As a manager, it’s your responsibility to help them improve. Take notes on communication skill gaps during meetings and provide feedback either one-on-one or at the beginning of the next meeting.

**Tip:** Imagine you’re a coach guiding your team to better performance. By honing their skills, you ensure that every player contributes effectively, making each meeting a winning game.

#### Meeting Length

Ensure that weekly team meetings are long enough to cover the agenda without rushing. The optimal length may need to be determined through trial and error, but the goal is to find a balance that allows thorough discussion without wasting time.

#### Core Values and Business Objectives

Reiterate core values and business objectives every week. This regular reinforcement helps maintain their importance and ensures alignment across the team. Consistent communication of these priorities prevents them from being perceived as less critical over time.

#### Camera Use in Virtual Meetings

Encourage the use of cameras during virtual meetings to enhance engagement and facilitate better communication through visual feedback. However, allow exceptions for valid reasons, such as privacy concerns or technical issues. Aim to have at least half of the participants with their cameras on to ensure active participation and effective communication.

#### Preparation is Key

Ensure that all participants come prepared. Send out the agenda in advance and ask team members to review it and come with any necessary updates or questions. Preparation minimizes time spent on catching up and maximizes productive discussion.

#### Clear Objectives for Each Meeting

Set clear, specific objectives for each meeting. What do you aim to achieve by the end of the session? Whether it’s making a decision, solving a problem, or aligning on a plan, having clear goals keeps the meeting focused and purposeful.

#### Encourage Participation

Foster an environment where every team member feels comfortable contributing. Encourage quieter team members to share their thoughts and ensure that all voices are heard. This inclusivity can lead to more innovative solutions and a more engaged team.

#### Action Items and Follow-Ups

At the end of each meeting, clearly outline the action items and assign responsibilities. Ensure that there is a follow-up mechanism in place to track the progress of these action items. This accountability drives results and keeps the team on track.

#### Continuous Improvement

Always look for ways to improve your meetings. After each session, take a few minutes to reflect on what went well and what could be better. Encourage your team to provide feedback and be open to making changes that enhance the effectiveness of your meetings.
