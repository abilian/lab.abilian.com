## Context - What's NEPHELE?

The NEPHELE project aims to develop a groundbreaking, open reference architecture and a "synergetic meta-orchestration" framework to manage hyper-distributed applications across the entire compute continuum, from IoT devices through edge computing to the cloud. It also proposes tackling IoT technology convergence and interoperability by introducing a lightweight software stack ("VOStack") for virtualizing IoT functions, and promotes an Eclipse-based development ecosystem for creating, deploying, and reusing these complex applications.

Ultimately, NEPHELE seeks to enhance European autonomy in data processing, foster an open edge ecosystem by integrating AI, 5G, and cybersecurity, and validate its innovations through diverse industrial use cases, while actively contributing to open-source communities and standardization efforts.

## Abilian's part in the project - H3NI

Abilian, through its H3NI project, is integrating its [[Public/Projects/Hop3/Hop3|Hop3]] open-source PaaS with NEPHELE's Synergetic Meta-Orchestrator (SMO) to enhance the orchestration of hyper-distributed applications across IoT, edge, and cloud environments. This initiative aims to deliver dynamic scaling, energy optimization, improved interoperability via REST APIs, and user-friendly interfaces for the SMO's complex features, while ensuring all developments are open-sourced.

Abilian will contribute to the SMO's functionality, particularly in areas like intent translation, resource placement, and potentially custom scheduling/scaling mechanisms, leveraging Hop3's deployment simplicity and GitOps workflows to simplify application lifecycle management within the NEPHELE ecosystem, even as the SMO itself is still under active development.
