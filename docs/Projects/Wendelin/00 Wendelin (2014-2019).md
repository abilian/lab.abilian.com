The Wendelin project is (was) a bold endeavor to create a superior open-source big data engine.

At its core, Wendelin aims to be an amalgamation of scikit-learn's machine learning capabilities and NEO's distributed storage framework. This hybrid nature offers the best of both worlds—powerful analytics from scikit-learn and the scalability of NEO—enabling the handling of large data sets that require out-of-core processing. Wendelin is not just another analytics engine; it's tailored to make the most out of the pythonic ecosystem of Numpy technologies.

While Wendelin has broad applicability, its immediate focus is on industrial big data and video processing. Whether it's predictive maintenance for machinery, intrusion detection systems, or energy consumption forecasting, Wendelin is equipped to handle it all. And thanks to its compatibility with other Numpy-based libraries like OpenCV and Pandas, its capabilities extend into diverse fields such as finance and media.

But Wendelin is not merely an academic exercise; it's designed for real-world impact. The project actively seeks business applications and encourages industrial partnerships. Unlike other open-source projects that rely heavily on venture capital and are vulnerable to hostile takeovers, Wendelin has envisioned a more sustainable model for long-term R&D. Businesses can extend Wendelin with both open-source and proprietary components to cater to specific vertical markets in big data. This symbiotic relationship ensures that part of the revenue gets reinvested into Wendelin's core development, especially into scikit-learn, thereby creating a self-sustaining cycle of growth and innovation.

In summary, Wendelin is not just about creating an open-source big data engine; it's about building a comprehensive, flexible, and business-friendly ecosystem that pushes the boundaries of what is possible with machine learning and big data analytics. It is not merely an exercise in technological prowess; it is a strategic initiative aimed at creating a self-sustaining and adaptable platform that can meet the ever-evolving challenges in big data analytics. With Wendelin, businesses don't just get a tool; they get a partner in navigating the complex world of big data.
