At Abilian, our work on the **HyperOpen X** project has been both a challenge and a catalyst for transformation. Two years ago, we set out to integrate our solutions into this ambitious open cloud ecosystem. The focus? Two critical components: **hyper_edge**, a convergent PaaS for automated service deployment, and **hyper_db**, a relational database solution for high-availability scenarios.

Looking back, 2024 has been a year of significant progress. Alongside our partners and collaborators, we’ve taken important steps to make Abilian SBE—our collaborative platform—ready for cloud-native and edge computing environments.

### hyper_edge: Bringing Abilian SBE to the Edge

The core promise of hyper_edge lies in its ability to manage distributed services with precision and resilience. Built on SlapOS, it allows deployments to span everything from cloud infrastructure to bare metal servers and isolated edge environments. For us at Abilian, this presented an opportunity to rethink how our platform could operate outside traditional cloud silos.

We began by adapting **Abilian SBE** to run seamlessly on SlapOS. This wasn’t just about making the software “compatible”—it meant rearchitecting components to automate workflows, handle recovery processes, and ensure consistent performance even in disconnected or resource-limited environments.

The result has been a successful deployment of Abilian SBE on SlapOS across a range of scenarios. Edge computing brings unique challenges: intermittent connectivity, hardware variability, and heightened performance demands. hyper_edge provided us with a robust foundation to navigate these issues, offering both stability and flexibility.

In parallel, we worked on improving developer experience. Integrating tools like the **Theia IDE** made it easier to configure and manage services on hyper_edge. This focus on usability ensures that edge deployment becomes more accessible—not just for our team, but for customers and partners adopting these solutions in production.

### hyper_db: Building the Future of Relational Databases

The story of hyper_db is about solving real-world needs for resilience and scalability. From the outset, we focused on ensuring that Abilian SBE could leverage hyper_db’s capabilities for its data-intensive workflows. PostgreSQL became our starting point, deployed on SlapOS for automated provisioning and lifecycle management.

But this was only the beginning. MariaDB, with its advanced clustering and replication features, offers immense value for high-availability scenarios—something that our partners at Signal18 have been actively developing. To bridge this gap, we began the work of making Abilian SBE fully compatible with MariaDB.

This effort has created exciting opportunities for synergy. Signal18’s **replication-manager** introduces automation around failover, backup, and recovery—critical for businesses relying on databases to keep their operations running smoothly. By aligning our work on hyper_db with theirs, we’re moving toward a more flexible and robust database solution that can operate in any environment, from cloud to on-premise deployments.

Another significant milestone has been the development of a storage plugin for Abilian Core. This allows large files—BLOBs—to be stored on object storage compatible with S3. The integration of S3-based external backups complements hyper_db’s broader goal of offering point-in-time recovery and other advanced data management capabilities.

### Collaboration Drives Innovation

One of the most exciting aspects of the HyperOpen X project has been its collaborative nature. Working alongside partners like Nexedi, Rapid.Space, and Signal18, we’ve seen firsthand how collective expertise can accelerate progress. Our work on hyper_db intersects with Signal18’s advancements in replication and cloud backups. The tools and mechanisms they’ve developed align perfectly with the needs of our customers and enhance the overall ecosystem.

This collaboration also reflects a deeper commitment to openness and digital sovereignty. By using open-source technologies like SlapOS and PostgreSQL, we’re contributing to a cloud infrastructure that is both resilient and independent. These principles matter. They ensure businesses have the freedom to control, adapt, and scale their solutions without vendor lock-in.

### What’s Next?

2024 has laid the groundwork for what’s to come. With hyper_edge, we’ve proven that Abilian SBE can thrive in edge environments, while our work on hyper_db has moved us closer to a fully automated, high-availability database offering. There’s still much to do—completing MariaDB integration, refining workflows, and expanding our testing in real-world scenarios.

As we look to 2025, we remain focused on delivering solutions that are not only technologically advanced but also practical, open, and ready to meet the evolving needs of our customers. The HyperOpen X project is a reminder of what’s possible when innovation is driven by collaboration and openness.

At Abilian, we’re proud to play our part in building the future of cloud and edge computing. Stay tuned.
