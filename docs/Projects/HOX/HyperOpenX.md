## HyperOpenX: A Modular Architecture for a Convergent Cloud

HyperOpenX's strength lies in its modular design, featuring a suite of interconnected components, each addressing a critical aspect of modern cloud computing:

*   **hyper_edge:** A convergent PaaS, powered by SlapOS, enabling automated deployment and management of distributed services across their lifecycle.
*   **hyper_cdn:** A high-performance, HTTP/3-based Content Delivery Network, leveraging a distributed Public Key Infrastructure for enhanced security and efficiency.
*   **hyper_db:** A robust, scalable, and highly available clustered relational Database as a Service, orchestrated by SlapOS.
*   **hyper_sec:** Security Operations (SecOps) as a Service, automating security policy enforcement and threat management.
*   **hyper_space:** A unified data space designed for seamless multi-cloud data management, access, and exploitation.
*   **And more:** HyperOpenX continues to expand its capabilities, exploring new frontiers in cloud innovation.

**A Roadmap for Success:** The project adheres to a well-defined 36-month roadmap, ensuring a structured and iterative development process:

1. **Proof of Concept (POC):** Demonstrating the feasibility of core technologies through initial prototypes.
2. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** Delivering core functionalities to validate key concepts and gather user feedback.
3. **Minimum Lovable Product (MLP):** Enhancing the user experience and adding features to delight early adopters.
4. **Minimum Marketable Product (MMP):**  Releasing a commercially viable and market-ready solution.

**Real-World Validation:** HyperOpenX goes beyond theoretical development. **Validation pilots** with industry partners are integral to the project, ensuring that the developed technologies are rigorously tested and refined in real-world scenarios.

**Open Calls for Broader Impact:** To maximize its impact, HyperOpenX actively engages the broader digital ecosystem through **funded open calls**. These initiatives encourage wider adoption of the developed technologies and foster innovation across various sectors.

HyperOpenX represents a bold step towards a more open, innovative, and sovereign cloud computing future for France and Europe. By combining cutting-edge technologies, a collaborative approach, and a strong focus on real-world applications, HyperOpenX is poised to reshape the European cloud computing landscape.
