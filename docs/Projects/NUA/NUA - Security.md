### Zaproxy

https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy.git "The OWASP ZAP core project"
The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the world’s most popular free security tools and is actively maintained by a dedicated international team of volunteers. It can help you automatically find security vulnerabilities in your web applications while you are developing and testing your applications. It's also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security testing.

NB: gros truc (200 KLOC de Java)
NB: Ce n'est pas un WAF. Ca peut quand même servir.
