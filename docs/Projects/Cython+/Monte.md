"Monte is a nascent dynamic programming language reminiscent of [Python](https://python.org/) and [E](http://erights.org/). It is based upon _The Principle of Least Authority_ (POLA), which governs interactions between objects, and a _capability-based object model_, which grants certain essential safety guarantees to all objects."
