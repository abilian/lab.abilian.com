## High-Level Alignment & Shared Vision

1.  **Digital Sovereignty:** This is the strongest and most obvious synergy. Both projects are explicitly focused on building European, open-source solutions to provide alternatives to proprietary systems, enabling organizations (especially public sector and SMEs) to retain control over their data and infrastructure.
2.  **Open Source Philosophy:** Both are deeply rooted in open source, promoting collaboration, transparency, and community-driven development.
3.  **Targeting Public Sector:** While Hop3 also targets SMEs, both see the public sector as a key user base requiring sovereign, secure, and manageable solutions.
4.  **Security & Compliance:** Both prioritize security (secure-by-design, supply chain security) and aim to facilitate compliance with European regulations (GDPR, CRA, potentially NIS2).
5.  **EU Focus:** Both projects have a clear European orientation and are involved in European initiatives (NGI0, EUCloudEdgeIoT for Hop3; direct engagement with DINUM/zendis for EU OS).

## A Perspective on EU OS & Abilian (Hop3) Synergy

The alignment between the EU OS project and Abilian's vision, particularly through its Hop3 PaaS, presents significant mutual perspectives:

1.  **For EU OS:** Abilian offers the perspective of **enhanced technical robustness and sovereign infrastructure support**. By leveraging Abilian's deep expertise in Nix, secure software supply chains, and PaaS architecture (Hop3), EU OS can strengthen its build processes, deployability, and even host its own development/distribution infrastructure on a sovereign European platform. This adds credibility and practical application of the sovereignty principle from the ground up.

2.  **For Abilian:** EU OS offers the perspective of becoming a **key catalyst for Hop3 adoption and growth within the European public sector**. As administrations embrace EU OS for desktops, a natural demand will arise for sovereign, manageable platforms to host their web applications and services. Hop3 is perfectly positioned to fill this gap, creating a clear pathway for Abilian to solidify its role as a pivotal enabler of a complete European sovereign digital stack.

**Overall Perspective:** This collaboration envisions a future where a European sovereign desktop (EU OS) seamlessly integrates with and drives demand for European sovereign application hosting (Hop3). This creates a robust, mutually reinforcing ecosystem that significantly benefits public administrations and accelerates Europe's journey towards genuine digital independence.
